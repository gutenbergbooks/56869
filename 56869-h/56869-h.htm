<p>The text, upon which the following observations and
comments are based, does not assume to be a literal translation
of the celebrated work of Droz. The original is
strongly idiomatic; and the author has carried an uncommon
talent of being laconic sometimes to the point of
obscurity. I have often found it impossible to convey to
the English reader a sentiment, perfectly obvious in the
original, in as few words as are there used. The French,
in its more numerous articles, more allowable and bold
personifications, and arbitrary use of gender, has, in the
hand of certain writers, this advantage over our language.
When the doctrines of the book are compared
one with the other, and each with the general bearing of
the work, the inculcation, namely, of the truth that <em>virtue
is happiness</em>, there will be found nothing immoral or reprehensible
in it. The author, on the whole, leans to
the Epicurean philosophy. Unfavorable, though erroneous
impressions have been very generally entertained of that
philosophy. In deference to that opinion, I have altogether
omitted the few sentences, which seemed appropriate to
some of the dogmas of the Epicureans. Nothing can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
more remote from their alleged impiety, than the general
tenor of this work. One of its most eloquent and impressive
chapters is that upon religion. There is a distinct
class in France, both numerous and important, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">literatures</i>. Many of the remarks of the author, bearing
chiefly upon that class, seemed inapplicable, or unintelligible
in our country, where there is no such class to address.
I have passed over many passages and parts of
chapters, which had an almost exclusive reference to persons
in that walk in life. I have added members of sentences,
and even whole sentences to the text, where such
additions seemed necessary to develope the doctrine to an
English reader.</p>

<p>In a word, I do not offer the text, as an exact translation,
but as the only treatise within the compass of my reading,
which has discussed the pursuit of happiness, as a science
or an art; and as one which has advanced more eloquent
and impressive sentiments upon the subject, than
I have elsewhere met. With the slight alterations, which
I have made, I have found this book to meet my own
thoughts; and I have laid out of the text all phrases and
passages, which spoke otherwise. I have availed myself
of the words of another, because they have expressed my
own views better than I could have hoped to express
them myself. This explanation will be my reply to all
remarks, touching mistranslation, or liberties taken with
the author.</p>

<p>The following thoughts, my dear children, are those
of an affectionate father going out of life, to those he
most loves, who are coming forward in it. I am perfectly
aware, that nothing but time can impart all the
dear bought instruction of experience. Upon innumerable
questions, that relate to life, you will receive efficient
teaching only by reaping the fruit of your own
errors. But one who has preceded you on the journey,
who has listened to the impressive oracles of years, may
impart some aid if you will listen with docility, to enable
you to anticipate the lessons of experimental acquaintance
with the world. In what I am about to write, I
trust I may bring you this aid. As you embark on
the uncertain voyage, I cannot but hope, that your filial
piety will incline you to a frequent recurrence to the parental
chart. You are aware, that circumstances have
brought me into contact with all conditions, and into a
view of all the aspects of life. I ought, therefore, to be
qualified to impart useful lessons upon the evils and
dangers of inexperience. You, at least, will not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
assumption in such lessons, when they result from the
remembrance of my own errors. You may consider
what follows, whether it be my own remarks, or what
I have adopted from others, as the gleanings of experimental
instruction, from what I have myself seen,
felt, suffered, or enjoyed; and as my comments upon
the influence, which my election of alternatives has had,
upon the amount of my own enjoyment or suffering.</p>

<p>You will find enough who are ready to inspire you
with indifference or disdain for such counsels. They
will indolently, and yet confidently, assure you, that the
theoretical discussion of the pursuit of happiness is, of
all visionary investigations, the most profitless and inapplicable;
that lecture, write, preach as we may, the future
will be, perhaps ought to be, as the past; that the
world is always growing older, without ever growing
wiser; and that men are evidently no more successful
in their search after happiness now, than in the remotest
periods of recorded history. They will affirm that man
has always been the sport of accident, the slave of his
passions, the creature of circumstances; that it is useless
to reason, vain to consult rules, imbecile to surrender
independence, to follow the guidance of those who assume
to be wise, or receive instruction from those who
have been taught by years. They will allege the utter
inefficacy of the lights of reason, philosophy, and
religion, judging from the little illumination, which they
have hitherto shed upon the paths of life. On the same
ground, and from the same reasonings, they might declaim
against every attempt, in every form to render the
world wiser and happier. With equal propriety they
might say, ‘close the pulpit, silence the press, cease from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
parental discipline, moral suasion, and the training of
education. Do what you will, the world will go on as
before.’ Who does not see the absurdity of such language?
Because we cannot do everything, shall we do
nothing? Because the million float towards the invisible
future without any pole star, or guided only by the
presumption of general opinion, is it proof conclusive
that none have been rendered happier in consequence
of having followed wiser guidance, and pursued happiness
by system?</p>

<p>Such is the practical creed of the great mass, with
whom you will be associated in life. I, on the contrary,
think entirely with the French philosopher, whose precepts
you are about to read, that this general persuasion
is palpably false and fatal; that much suffering may
be avoided, and much enjoyment obtained by following
rules, and pursuing happiness by system; that I have
had the fortune to meet with numbers, who were visible
proofs that men may learn how to be happy. I am
confident that the far greater portion of human suffering
is of our own procuring, the result of ignorance and
mistaken views, and that it is a superfluous and unnecessary
mixture of bitterness in the cup of human life.
I firmly believe that the greater number of deaths, instead
of being the result of specific diseases, to which
they are attributed, are really caused by a series of
imperceptible malign influences, springing from corroding
cares, griefs, and disappointments. To say, that more
than half of the human race die of sorrow, and a broken
heart, or in some way fall victims to their passions,
may seem like advancing a revolting doctrine; but it is,
nevertheless, in my mind, a simple truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not <em>see</em> the operations of grief upon some
one or all the countless frail and delicate constituents of
human life. But if physiology could look through the
infinitely complicated web of our structure with the
power of the solar microscope, it would behold every
chagrin searing some nerve, paralyzing the action of
some organ, or closing some capillary; and that
every sigh draws its drop of life blood from the heart.
Nature is slow in resenting her injuries; but the
memory of them is indelibly impressed, and treasured
up for a late, but certain revenge. Nervousness,
lowness of spirits, headache, and all the countless
train of morbid and deranged corporeal and mental
action, are, at once, the cause and the effect of sorrow
and anxiety, increased by a constant series of action
and reaction. Thought and care become impressed
upon the brow. The bland essence of cheerfulness
evaporates. The head becomes shorn of its locks; and
the frosts of winter gather on the temples. These concurrent
influences silently sap the stamina of life; until,
aided by some adventitious circumstance, which we call
cold, fever, epidemic, dyspepsia&mdash;death lays his hand
upon the frame that by the sorrows and cares of life
was prepared for his dread office. The bills of mortality
assign a name to the mortal disease different from
the true one.</p>

<p>Cheerfulness and equanimity are about the only
traits that have invariably marked the life of those
who have lived to extreme old age. Nothing is
more clearly settled by experience, than that grief acts
as a slow poison, not only in the immediate infliction of
pain, but in gradually impairing the powers of life, and
in subtracting from the sum of our days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>If, then, by any process of instruction, discipline and
mental force, we can influence our circumstances, banish
grief and create cheerfulness, we can, in the same
degree, reduce rules, for the pursuit of happiness, to a
system; and make that system a matter of science.
Can we not do this? The very million who deride the
idea of seeking for enjoyment through the medium of
instruction, unconsciously exercise the power in question
to a certain extent&mdash;though not to the extent, of which
they are capable. All those wise individuals, who have
travelled with equanimity and cheerfulness through the
diversified scenes of life, making the most of its good,
and the least of its evils, bear a general testimony to
the truth of this fact. We find in them a conviction
that they had such power, and a force of character
that enabled them to act according to their convictions.</p>

<p>No person deserves the name of a philosopher, who
is not wise in relation to the great purpose of life. In the
same proportion, then, as I convince you, that by our own
voluntary, physical and mental discipline, we can act
upon circumstances, and influence our temperament, and
thus bear directly upon our happiness, I shall be able to
stir up your powers, and call forth your energy of character,
to apply that discipline in your own case. In
the same proportion I shall be instrumental in training
you to the highest exercise of your reason, and the attainment
of true philosophy.</p>

<p>The elements upon which you are to operate, are
your circumstances, habits, and modes of thinking and
acting. The <em>philosopher of circumstances</em><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> denies that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
you can act upon these. But, by his unwearied efforts
to propagate his system, he proves, that he does not
himself act upon his avowed convictions. The impulse
of all our actions from birth to death, the spring of all
our movements is a conviction, that we can alter and improve
our condition. We have a consciousness stronger
than our reason, that we can control our circumstances.
We can change our regimen and habits; and by patience
and perseverance, even our temperament. Every
one can cite innumerable and most melancholy instances
of those who have done it for evil. The habit of indulging
in opium, tobacco, ardent spirits, or any of the
pernicious narcotics, soon reduces the physical and
mental constitution to that temperament, in which these
stimulants are felt to be necessary. A corresponding
change is produced in the mind and disposition.
The frequent and regular use of medicine, though it
may have been wholly necessary at first, finally becomes
an inveterate habit. No phenomenon of physiology
is more striking, than the facility with which the
human constitution immediately commences a conformity
to whatsoever change of circumstances, as of climate,
habit, or aliment, we impose upon it. It is a most impressive
proof, that the Creator has formed man capable
of becoming the creature of all climates and conditions.</p>

<p>If we may change our temperament both of body and
mind for evil, as innumerable examples prove that we
may, why not as easily for good? Our habits certainly
are under our control; and our modes of thinking, however
little the process may have been explained, are, in
some way, shaped by our voluntary discipline. We have
high powers of self-command, as every one who has made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the effort to exercise them, must be conscious. We
have inexhaustible moral force for self-direction, if we
will only recognise and exert it. We owe most of our
disgusts and disappointments, our corroding passions and
unreasonable desires, our fretfulness, gloom and self-torment,
neither to nature nor fate; but to ourselves, and
our reckless indifference to those rules, that ought to
guide our pursuit of happiness. Let a higher education
and a truer wisdom disenthral us from our passions,
and dispel the mists of opinion and silence the authority
of example. Let us commence the pursuit of happiness
on the right course, and seek it where alone it is to be
found. Equanimity and moderation will shed their mild
radiance upon our enjoyments; and in our reverses we
shall summon resignation and force of character; and,
according to the sublime ancient maxim, we shall become
masters of events and of ourselves.</p>

<p>I am sensible that there will always be a sufficient
number of those, deemed philosophers, who, notwithstanding
their rules, have wandered far from their aim.
Such there will always be, so long as there are stirring
passions within or hidden dangers around us; and there
will be shipwrecks, so long as human cupidity and ambition
tempt self-confident and unskilful mariners upon the
fickle and tumultuous bosom of the ocean. But is this
proof that a disciplined pilot would not be most likely
to make the voyage in safety, or that the study of navigation
is useless?</p>

<p>My affectionate desire is, to draw your attention to
those moral resources which your Creator has placed at
your command. How many millions have floated down
the current in the indolent supineness of inactivity, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
had they been aware of their internal means of active
resistance, would have risen above the pressure of their
circumstances! Who can deny, that there is a manifest
difference, even as things now are, between the moral
courage of action and endurance, put forth by a disciplined
and reflecting mind, possessing force of character,
and the stupid and passive abandonment, with which a
savage meets pain and death?</p>

<p>May you speed on your voyage under the influence
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucida sidera</i>, or, in higher phrase, may Providence
be your guide.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PHYSICAL, ORGANIC AND MORAL LAWS.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>In relation to this most important subject, read <cite>Combe
on the Constitution of Man</cite>, a book, which I consider
admirable for its broad, philosophic, and just views of
the laws of the universe, in their bearing upon the constitution
of our physical and moral nature. You are
not unaware, that I had presented you similar views,
and inculcated the same master principles, long before
this excellent work was published. Thousands, in all
ages, have entertained the same extended conceptions
of the divine plan, and its bearing upon man and all beings,
upon this and all other worlds. But the honor
belongs to this author, to have given form and systematic
arrangement to these views. I have given my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
thoughts upon this subject at the commencement of my
letters, and have subjoined remarks upon the Christian
religion at the close, because I deem that M. Droz, in
not recurring to these fundamental principles at the beginning
of his work, and in dwelling with so little earnestness
upon the hope of the gospel, as an element of
happiness, at the close, has left chasms in it which ought
to be supplied.</p>

<p>The sect, numerous in my day, in yours, I trust, will
have disappeared, who hold that religion and philosophy
are militant and irreconcilable principles. Such persons
are accustomed to brand these broad views of Providence
and moral obligation with the odium of impiety.
You will hardly need my assurance, that, if I thought
with them, <em>my right hand should forget its cunning</em>,
before I would allow anything to escape my pen which
might have the least tendency to impair in your minds
the future and eternal sanctions of virtue. I shall
hereafter enlarge upon my persuasion, that, so far from
being in opposition, religion and philosophy, when rightly
understood, will be found resting on the same immutable
foundation. It is because the misguided friends of
religion have attempted to sustain them, as separate and
hostile interests, in my view, that the former has made
so little progress towards becoming universal. It will
one day be understood, that whatever wars with
reason and common sense, is equally hostile to religion.
The simple and unchangeable truths of Christianity
will be found to violate none of our most obvious
convictions. Truth will reassume her legitimate reign.
Piety, religion and morals, our best interests for this life,
and our surest preparations for a future one, will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
found exactly conformable to the eternal order of things,
and the system of the gospel will become universal,
according to its legitimate claims. True piety, in my
mind, is equally our duty, our wisdom and happiness.
To behold God everywhere in his works, to hold communion
with him in a contemplative and admiring spirit,
to love, and trust him, to find, in the deep and constantly
present persuasion of his being and attributes, a sentiment
of exhaustless cheerfulness and excitement to duty,
I hold to be the source of the purest and sublimest
pleasure, that earth can afford.</p>

<p>True philosophy unfolds the design of final causes
with a calm and humble wisdom. It finds the Creator
everywhere, and always acting in wisdom and power.
It traces the highest benevolence of intention, where the
first aspect showed no apparent purpose, or one that
seemed to tend to misery; offering new inducements to
learn the first and last lesson of religion, and the
ultimate attainment of human wisdom&mdash;resignation to
the will of God. In vindicating his ways to men, it
declares that so long as we do not understand the laws
of our being and so long as we transgress them, either
ignorantly, or wilfully and unconsciously, misery to
ourselves must just as certainly follow as that we can
neither resist nor circumvent them; and that the Omnipotent
has forged every link of the chain, that connects
our own unhappiness with every transgression of the
laws of our nature.</p>

<p>We find ourselves making a part of an existing universe
which neither ignorance, nor wisdom, doubting,
nor confidence can alter. If we know the order, of
which we are the subjects, and conform to it, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
happy. If we ignorantly, or wilfully transgress it, the
order is in no degree changed, or impeded. It moves
irresistibly on, and the opposition is crushed. How wisdom
and benevolence are reconcilable with the permission
of this ignorance and opposition, in other words,
why partial evil exists in God’s universe, it is not my object
to inquire. The inquiry would not only be fruitless,
but would in no degree alter the fact, that what we
call evil does exist. It is enough for us to know, that,
as far as human research has reached, or can reach,
the more profoundly we investigate the subject, the more
clearly are design, wisdom and benevolence discoverable.
Beyond our ken, right reason, guided by humility, would
infer, that, where we cannot trace the impress of these
attributes, it is not because they are not discoverable,
but because our powers are not equal to the discovery.
If we had a broader vision, and were more fully acquainted
with the relations of all parts of God’s universe, the
one to the other, and all the reasons of the permanent
ordinances of his government, we should be able to understand
the necessity of partial evil to the general good;
we should understand, why it rains on the waste ocean,
when drought consigns whole countries to aridity and
desolation; in a word, why ignorance, transgression,
misery and death have a place in our system.</p>

<p>All that we now know is, that the natural laws of this
system are universal, invariable, unbending; that physical
and moral tendencies are the same all over our world;
and we have every reason to believe, over all other worlds.
Wherever moral beings keep in harmony with these laws,
there is no instance, in which happiness is not the result.
Men never enjoy health, vigor, and felicity in disobedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to them. The whole infinite contrivance of everything
above, around, and within us, appears directed to
certain benevolent issues; and all the laws of nature are
in perfect harmony with the whole constitution of man.</p>

<p>I shall not enter upon the subtle controversies of
moral philosophers, as to the fundamental principle of
moral obligation, whether it be expediency, the nature of
things, or the will of God? In my view these are rather
questions about words, than things. The nature of
things is a part of the will of God; and expediency is
conformity to this unchanging order. An action derives
its moral complexion from being conformed to the
will of God, and the nature of things; and whatever is
so conformed, is expedient; consequently all the different
foundations of morals, when examined, are found to
be precisely the same.</p>

<p>My notions of morality are, that it is conformity to
the physical, organic and moral laws of the universe.
Some will choose to call it expediency; others, the will
of God; and others still, the constitution of things.
These views, when reduced to their elements, are the
same, call them by what names we may. We may obviously
divide these laws into three classes. The first
series we call physical laws, or those which act upon the
material universe, and upon ourselves as a part of that universe.
The second we call organic, or those which regulate
the origin, growth, well-being and dissolution of organized
beings. The last, denominated moral, act chiefly
on the intellectual universe. They are founded on our
relations to the sentient universe and God.</p>

<p>We infer from analogy, that these laws always have
been, are, and always will be, invariably the same; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that they prevail alike in every portion of God’s universe.
We so judge, because we believe the existing order of
things to be the wisest and the best. We know that
the physical laws actually do prevail alike in every part
of our world, and as far beyond it, as the highest helps
of astronomy can aid our researches into the depths of
immensity. Is it not probable, that if we could investigate
the system, as far as the utmost stretch of thought,
we should find no point, where the laws of gravity, light,
heat and motion do not prevail; where the sentient beings
are not restricted to the same moral relations, as in our
world? Wherever the empire of science has extended,
we note these laws equally prevalent, in a molecule and
a world, and from the lowest order of sentient beings
up to man. The arrangement of the great whole, it
should seem, must be a single emanation from the same
wisdom and will, perfectly uniform throughout the whole
empire. What an impressive motive to study these laws,
and conform to them, is it, to know, that they are as irresistible,
as the divine power, as universal, as the divine
presence, as permanent as the divine existence;&mdash;that
there is no evading them, that no art can disconnect misery
from transgressing them, that no change of place or
time, that not death, nor any transformation which our
conscious being can undergo, will, during the revolutions
of eternity, dispense any more with the necessity
of observing these laws, than during our present transitory
existence in clay!</p>

<p>I need not dwell a moment upon the proofs of the
absolute identity of the physical laws. No one need be
told, that a ship floats, water descends, heat warms, and
cold freezes, and that all physical properties of matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
are the same over the globe. We shall only show by a
few palpable examples, that our system is arranged in
conformity to the organic laws. Every discovery in the
kingdom of animated nature developes new instances.</p>

<p>In the tropical regions, the muscular energy is less, in
proportion as the natural fertility of the soil is greater.
In colder latitudes muscular energy is increased; and
ruder elements, and a more sterile nature, proportion their
claims accordingly. In arctic regions no farinaceous food
ripens. Sojourners in that climate find, that bread and
vegetable diet do not furnish the requisite nutriment;
that pure animal food is the only sustenance that will
there maintain the tone of the system, imparting a delightful
vigor and buoyancy of mind. Strange as it may
seem, to conform to this necessity, these dreary countries
abound in infinite numbers and varieties of animals,
fowls and fishes. The climate favors the drying and
preserving of animal food, which is thus prepared to sustain
the inhabitants, when nature imprisons the material
creation in chains of ice, and wraps herself up in her
mantle of snow. Thus, if we survey the whole globe,
the food, climate and other circumstances will be found
accommodated to the inhabitants; and they, as far as
they conform to the organic laws, will be found adapted
to their climate and mode of subsistence.</p>

<p>In all positions man finds himself called upon, by the
clear indications of the organic laws, to take that free
and cheerful exercise, which is calculated to develope
vigorous muscular, nervous and mental action. The laborer
digs, and the hunter chases for subsistence; but
finds at the same time health and cheerfulness. The
penalty of the violation of this organic law by the indulgence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of indolence is debility, enfeebled action, both
bodily and mental, dyspepsia with all its horrid train, and
finally death. On the other hand, the penalty of over exertion,
debauchery, intemperance, and excess of every species,
comes in other forms of disease and suffering. These
laws, though not so obviously and palpably so, are as
invariable and inevitable, as those of attraction, or magnetism;
and yet the great mass of our species, even in
what we call enlightened and educated countries, do
not recognise, and obey them. It is in vain for them,
that, from age to age, the same consequences have ensued,
as the eternal heralds of the divinity, proclaiming
to all people, in all languages, that his laws carry their
sanctions with them. One of our most imperious duties,
then, is to study these laws, to make ourselves conversant
with their bearing upon our pursuit of happiness, that
we may conform to them. When we have become acquainted
with their universality and resistless power, we
shall indulge no puerile hope that we may enjoy the present
gratification of infringing them, and then evade the ultimate
consequences. We shall as soon calculate to
change condition with the tenants of the air and the
waters, as expect to divert any one of them from its onward
course.</p>

<p>He then is wise, who looks round him with a searching
eye to become fully possessed, without the coloring
of sophistical wishes and self-deceiving expectation, of
the actual conditions of his being; and who, instead of
imagining, that the unchangeable courses of nature will
conform to him, his ignorance, interests or passions, shapes
his course so as to conform to them. He will no more
expect, for example, that he can indulge his appetites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
give scope to his passions, and yield himself to the
seductions of life, and escape without a balance of misery
in consequence, than he would calculate to throw
himself unhurt, from a mountain precipice.</p>

<p>So far as regards himself, he will study the organic
laws, in reference to their bearing upon his mind, his
health, his morals, his happiness. He will strive to be
cheerful; for he knows that it is a part of the constitution
of things, that cheerfulness tends to physical and mental
health. He will accustom himself to exercise, and will
avoid indolence, because he understands that he was
formed to be an active being, and that he cannot yield to
his slothful propensities, without forfeiting the delightful
feeling of energy, and the power to operate upon events,
instead of being passively borne along by them. He will be
active, that he may feel conscious power. He will rise
above the silent and invisible influence of sloth, and will
exult in a feeling of force and self-command, for the
same reasons that the eagle loves to soar aloft, and look
upon the sun; because a sensation of power, and
a sublime liberty are enjoyed in the flight. He will
be temperate in the gratification of his appetites and
passions, because he is aware, that every excessive indulgence
strikes a balance of suffering against him, which
he must discharge soon, or late; and helps to forge
a chain of habit, that will render it more difficult for
him to resist the next temptation to indulgence. He
will rise early from sleep, because nature calls him
to early rising, in all her cheerful voices, in the matin
song of birds, the balmy morning freshness and elasticity
of the air, and the renovated cry of joy from the whole
animal creation. He will do this, because he has early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
heard complaints from all sides of the shortness of life,
and because he is sensible, that he who rises every day
two hours before the common period, will prolong the
ordinary duration of life by adding six years of the
pleasantest part of existence. He will rise early, because
next after the intemperate, no human being offers
a more unworthy spectacle, than is presented by the
man, who calls himself rational and immortal, who
sees before him a greater amount of knowledge, duty
and happiness, than he could hope to compass in a
thousand years; and who yet turns himself indolently
from side to side, during the hours of the awakening of
nature, enjoying only the luxury of a savage or a brute,
in a state of dozing existence little superior to the
dreamless sleep of the grave. I test the character of a
youth of whom I wish to entertain hope, by this criterion.
If he can nobly resist his propensities, if he can
act from reason against his inclinations, if he can trample
indolence under foot, if he can always make the effort to
show the intellectual in the ascendant over the animal
being, I note him as one, who will be worthy of eminence,
whether he attain it or not.</p>

<p>In a word, there is something of dignity and intellectual
grandeur in the aspect of the young, who live in obedience
to the organic and moral laws, which commands
at once that undefined, and almost unconscious estimation
and respect, which all minds involuntarily pay to
true greatness. Such was the image of the poet, when
he delineated the angel <em>severe in youthful beauty</em>; and
such that of the Mantuan, when he compares Neptune
rebuking and hushing the winds, to a venerable man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
allaying by his words of peace, the uproar of an infuriated
populace.</p>

<p>Were I to enter into details of your obligations to understand
and obey these laws, as they relate to the various
periods, pursuits and duties of life, I should offer
you a volume, instead of an outline, which, from the examples
given, your own thoughts can easily fill out. But
that I may not leave these momentous duties wholly
untouched, I shall dwell a moment on their bearing upon
a most important epoch of life, one which, perhaps more
than any other, gives the color to future years either of
happiness or misery.</p>

<p>When the young reach that period, when nature invokes
them to assume the obligations of connubial life,
this knowledge and conformity will cause them to
pause, and reflect on what is before them, and will interdict
them from following the inconsiderate throng, in
entering into that decisive condition, consulting no other
lights, than a morbid fancy, those impulses which are
common to all other animals, or sordid calculations of interest.
They are well apprized, that the declamations of
satire, and the bitter and common jest of all civilized
people, upon wedded life, have but too much foundation
in truth. They perceive at a glance, that those who
with such views take on them the obligations of the conjugal
state have no right to hope anything better than
satiety, ill-humor, monotonous disgust, and the insupportable
imprisonment of two persons, in intimate and
indissoluble partnership, who find weariness and penance
in being together, who are reminded, at once
by the void in their hearts, and their mutual inability
to fill it, that they must not only endure the pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of being chained together, but feel, that they are thus
barred from a happier union, partly by shame, partly
by public opinion, and, more than all, by the obstacles,
wisely thrown by all civilized nations in the way of
obtaining divorce. There can be no doubt, that the
common views of the universal unhappiness of the wedded
state in all Christian countries are the result of gross
exaggeration. Making all allowances for errors from
this source, language is too feeble, to delineate the countless
and unutterable miseries, that, in all time since the
institution of marriage, as recognised by Christianity,
have resulted from these incompatible unions, for the simple
reason, that, in this transaction, of so much more moment
than almost any other, scarcely one of the parties
in a thousand, it is believed, takes the least note of it in
relation to the organic and moral laws. The young and
the aged, the feeble and the strong, the healthy and the
diseased, the beautiful and the deformed, the mild and
the fierce, the intellectual and the purely animal, the rich
and the poor, bring their incompatibilities to a common
stock, add ruinous excesses of temperament together,
unite under a spell, reckless of the live-long consequences
involved, and arouse from a short trance to the conscious
and sober sadness of waking misery. To them
the hackneyed declamations against marriage have a
terrible import. Weariness, discontent, ennui, relieved
only by the fierceness of domestic discord, and a wretchedness
aggravated by the consciousness that there is no
escape from it, but by death, is the issue of a union consummated
under illusive expectations of more than mortal
happiness. How many millions have found this to
be the reality of their youthful dreams! Yet if this most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
important union is contracted under animal impulses,
without any regard to moral and intellectual considerations,
without any investigation of the organic and social
fitness of the case, without inquiry into the compatibility,
without a mutual understanding of temperament, dispositions,
and habits; who cannot foresee, that the propensities
will soon languish in satiety; that repentance and
discord and disgust and disaffection and loathing, in proportion
to the remembered raptures forever passed away,
will rudely open the eyes of the parties to their real and
permanent condition, and that by a law as certain and
inevitable, as that which propels water down a precipice!
And this is not the darkest shade in the picture. By
the same laws children are born with the doubled excess
of the temperaments of their parents; or puny, undeveloped
and feeble, or racked by all the fiercer passions
of our nature. Opening their eyes in this scene, which
the guilty thoughtlessness of successive generations has
rendered little better than a vast lazar house, evil example,
gloom, unregulated tempers, repining and misery
are their first and last spectacles. They advance
into life to repeat the errors of their parents, to make
common stock of their misery anew, to multiply the number
of the unhappy, or perhaps worse, to tenant hospitals,
and the receptacles of human ignorance and misery.</p>

<p>Can any question be imagined in life, in regard to
which you ought so deliberately to pause, investigate and
weigh all the bearings of the case? And yet can any other
important transaction be named, upon which, in this view,
so little thought is bestowed, and which is entered into
with such reckless blindness to consequences? He, who
determines to respect the laws of his being, will study his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
own temperament, and that of the other party, and weigh
the excesses and defects, as one convinced by the general
analogy of animated nature, that the physical and
mental character, the constitutional and moral temperament
of the offspring, in the ordinary course of things,
will be a compound of that of the parents. If he find
himself subject to any peculiar corporeal infirmity, hereditary
tendency to disease, overbearing propensities towards
indulgence, or excess, unbalanced passions, or
morbid mental obliquity, he will be studiously solicitous,
that the other party shall not be laboring under similar
disqualifications. I may not follow out the subordinate
details. Your thoughts cannot but suggest innumerable
considerations, that I pass in silence. Will any moral
being, capable of conscientious views of the ultimate bearing
of his actions, dare to treat this subject, all momentous
as it is, with unphilosophic levity and ridicule?
Will any one say, that such discussions ought to be pretermitted
by a parent? I affirm, that such are not my
notions of the obligations of decorum and propriety.
The world has been too long peopled with mere animals
bound by the laws, and doomed to the responsibilities of
rationality, and yet acting like the orders below them,
without a capacity for finding their happiness. If, being
men, and inheriting either the privileges, or the doom of
men, we will choose to consider ourselves merely as
animals, shall we dare to arraign Providence, or fill the
world with murmurs, if we enjoy not the peculiar pleasures
of either race, and are subject to the miseries of
both? When you are aware that such considerations
must affect not only your own happiness, or misery, but
that of your offspring, a whole coming generation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the hopes of the regeneration and improvement of a
world, you will be sensible, that silence in such a discussion
would be guilty pride. I perfectly coincide with
the conclusions of Combe upon this subject, and transcribe
for your benefit an admirable exposition of my
views from the notes appended to his book on the <cite>Constitution
of Man</cite>.</p>

<p>‘It is a very common error, not only among philosophers,
but among practical men, to imagine that the <em>feelings</em>
of the mind are communicated to it through the
medium of the <em>intellect</em>; and, in particular, that if no
indelicate objects reach the eyes, or expressions penetrate
the ears, perfect purity will necessarily reign within
the soul; and, carrying this mistake into practice, they
are prone to object to all discussion of the subjects treated
of under the ‘Organic Laws,’ in works designed for
general use. But their principle of reasoning is fallacious,
and the practical result has been highly detrimental
to society. The <em>feelings</em> have existence and activity
distinct from the <em>intellect</em>; they spur it on to obtain their
own gratification; and it may become either their slave
or guide, according as it is enlightened concerning their
constitution and objects, and the laws of nature to which
they are subjected. The most profound philosophers
have inculcated this doctrine; and, by phrenological observation,
it is demonstrably established. The organs
of the feelings are distinct from those of the intellectual
faculties; they are larger; and, as each faculty, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris
paribus</i>, acts with a power proportionate to the size of
its organ, the feelings are obviously the active or impelling
powers. The cerebellum, or organ of Amativeness,
is the largest of the whole mental organs; and, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
endowed with natural activity, it fills the mind spontaneously
with emotions and suggestions which may be directed,
controlled and resisted, in outward manifestation,
by intellect and moral sentiment, but which cannot be
prevented from arising nor eradicated after they exist.
The whole question, therefore, resolves itself into this,
Whether it is most beneficial to enlighten and direct that
feeling, or (under the influence of an error in philosophy,
and false delicacy founded on it), to permit it to riot in all
the fierceness of a blind animal instinct, withdrawn from
the eye of reason, but not thereby deprived of its vehemence
and importunity. The former course appears to
me to be the only one consistent with reason and morality;
and I have adopted it in reliance on the good sense
of my readers, that they will at once discriminate between
practical instruction concerning this feeling, addressed
to the intellect, and lascivious representations
addressed to the mere propensity itself; with the latter
of which the enemies of all improvement may attempt to
confound my observations. Every function of the mind
and body is instituted by the Creator; all may be abused;
and it is impossible regularly to avoid abuse of them,
except by being instructed in their nature, objects, and
relations. This instruction ought to be addressed exclusively
to the intellect; and when it is so, it is science
of the most beneficial description. The propriety, nay,
necessity, of acting on this principle, becomes more and
more apparent, when it is considered that the discussions
of the text suggest only intellectual ideas to individuals
in whom the feeling in question is naturally weak, and
that such minds perceive no indelicacy in knowledge
which is calculated to be useful; while, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hand, persons in whom the feeling is naturally strong,
are precisely those who stand in need of direction, and
to whom, of all others, instruction is the most necessary.’</p>

<p>No art in these days is better understood, by those
who have found their interest in investigating the subject,
than that of improving the races of the lower animals.
Every species, upon which the effort has been
made, has been found perfectly subservient to the art.
The desirable forms and qualities are selected, and the
proper means of improvement applied. The wished
result is not obtained to its full extent in the first generation;
but a uniform approximation commences; and
every successive amelioration brings the animal nearer
to the requisite standard. The whole art is founded on
observation of the organic laws of the races, and the
general fact, that the instincts, qualities, temperament,
form and color of the animals are hereditary, and transmissible.
These are truths so well known, that the grazier,
and the shepherd apply them constantly in rearing
their domestic animals. Shall they be disregarded,
when it becomes known, that they bear equally upon the
improvement of man, <em>next in dignity to angels</em>? Shall
these considerations rear a nobler race of animals, and,
by overlooking them, shall man alone be consigned to
degradation?</p>

<span class="fs70">THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>I proceed to examples and developments of the doctrine,
chiefly insisted upon in the former letter. I draw
them chiefly from Mr Combe, premising, that they exactly
coincide with views which you cannot but remember
to have heard me advance, before I had read his
book on <cite>the constitution of man</cite>. It is a law of the animal
creation, that not only the natural but even the acquired
qualities are transmitted by parents to their offspring;
and man, as an organized being, is subject to laws similar
to those which govern the organization of the lower animals.
‘Children,’ says Dr Pritchard, ‘resemble in
feature and constitution both parents; but I think more
generally the father.’ Changes produced by external
causes in the constitution and appearance of the individual
are temporary; and, in general, acquired characters
are transient, terminating with the individual, and
having no influence on the progeny. The mental development
of the Circassian race is known to be of the
highest order. The nobles of Persia are children of
Circassian mothers, and they are remarkable, in that
country, for their mental and corporeal superiority over
the other classes. Every one acquainted with the
condition of our southern slaves, well understands the
obvious fact, that the mulattoes are much superior, in
quickness and capability of acquiring and retaining knowledge,
to the negroes. The Indian half-breeds are remarkable
for the immediate ascendency, which they acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in their tribes over the full-blooded Indians. In
oriental India, the intermarriages of the Hindoos with
Europeans have produced an intermediate race much
superior to the natives, and destined, it is already predicted,
to be the future sovereigns of India. In fact, physiology
has deduced no conclusion more certain, than
that, in ordinary cases, the temperament and intellect of
the children are a compound of that of their parents.
Of this I might produce innumerable instances from history
of the Alexanders, Cæsars, and Antonines, the distinguished
great and wise, of ancient and modern times;
and equally, in the opposite direction, in the Neros and
Caligulas, the depraved and abandoned of all ages and
countries, where observation has been able to trace their
parentage.</p>

<p>One of the most fertile sources of human misery, then,
arises from persons uniting in marriage, whose tempers,
talents and dispositions do not harmonize. If it be true
that natural talents and dispositions are connected by the
Creator with particular constitutions of the parents, it is
obviously one of his institutions, that these constitutions
should be most seriously taken into the calculation in forming
a compact for life. The Creator, having formed such
ordinances in the unchangeable arrangements of nature,
as to confer happiness, when they are discovered and observed,
and misery, when they are unknown or unobserved,
it is obviously our best wisdom to investigate and
respect them. If individuals, after this truth reaches
their conviction should go on, in imitation of the common
example, to form reckless connexions, which can only
eventuate in sorrow, it is obvious that they must do so
either from contempt of the effects of this influence upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the happiness of domestic life, and a secret belief, that
they may in some way evade its consequences, or from
the predominance of avarice, or some other animal feeling,
precluding them from yielding obedience to what
they see to be an institution of the Creator.</p>

<p>At the first aspect of this subject three alternatives are
presented, one of which, it should seem, must have a
determining power upon the offspring. Either, in the
first place, the corporeal and mental constitution, which
the parents themselves inherit at birth, are transmitted
so absolutely, as that the children are exact copies
of the parents, without variation or modification, sex
following sex; or, in the second place, the inherent qualities
of the father and mother combine, and are transmitted
in a modified form to the offspring; or, thirdly, the
qualities of the children are determined jointly by the
constitution of the parents, and the faculties and temperaments,
which predominated in power and energy at
the particular period, when the organic existence of the
child commenced.</p>

<p>If these views are correct, and if a man and woman
about to marry, have not only their own domestic happiness
but that of five or more human beings depending
on their attention to considerations essentially the same
as the foregoing, how differently ought this contract to
be viewed from the common aspect, which it presents to
persons assuming its solemn stipulations! Yet it is astonishing,
to what extent pecuniary and other minor considerations
will induce men to investigate and observe
the natural laws; and how small an influence moral and
rational considerations exert upon this most important of
all earthly connexions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot forbear, under this head, quoting entire another
passage from the author, from whom I have substantially
drawn many of the foregoing observations.</p>

<p>‘Rules, however, are best taught by examples; and
I shall, therefore, proceed to mention some facts that
have fallen under my own notice, or been communicated
to me from authentic sources, illustrative of the practical
consequences of infringing the law of hereditary descent.</p>

<p>‘A man, aged about fifty, possessed a brain, in which
the animal, moral, and knowing intellectual organs were
all strong, but the reflecting weak. He was pious, but
destitute of education; he married an unhealthy young
woman, deficient in moral development, but of considerable
force of character; and several children were
born. The father and mother were far from being happy;
and, when the children attained to eighteen or twenty
years of age, they were adepts in every species of
immorality and profligacy; they picked their father’s
pockets, stole his goods, and got them sold back to him,
by accomplices, for money, which was spent in betting
and cock-fighting, drinking, and low debauchery. The
father was heavily grieved; but knowing only two resources,
he beat the children severely as long as he was
able, and prayed for them; his words were, that “if, <em>after
that</em>, it pleased the Lord to make vessels of wrath of
them, the Lord’s will must just be done.” I mention this
last observation, not in jest, but in great seriousness. It
was impossible not to pity the unhappy father; yet who
that sees the institutions of the Creator to be in themselves
wise, but in this instance to have been directly
violated, will not acknowledge that the bitter pangs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
poor old man were the consequences of his own ignorance;
and that it was an erroneous view of the divine administration,
which led him to overlook his own mistakes, and
to attribute to the Almighty the purpose of making vessels
of wrath of his children, as the only explanation
which he could give of their wicked dispositions. Who
that sees the cause of his misery must not lament that his
piety should not have been enlightened by philosophy,
and directed to obedience, in the first instance, to the organic
institutions of the Creator, as one of the prescribed
conditions, without observance of which he had no
title to expect a blessing upon his offspring.</p>

<p>‘In another instance, a man, in whom the animal organs,
particularly those of Combativeness and Destructiveness,
were very large, but with a pretty fair moral and intellectual
development, married, against her inclination, a
young woman, fashionably and showily educated, but
with a very decided deficiency in Conscientiousness.
They soon became unhappy, and even blows were said
to have passed between them, although they belonged to
the middle rank of life. The mother, in this case, employed
the children to deceive and plunder the father,
and, latterly, spent the produce in drink. The sons inherited
the deficient morality of the mother, and the ill
temper of the father. The family fireside became a
theatre of war, and, before the sons attained a majority,
the father was glad to get them removed from his house,
as the only means by which he could feel even his life
in safety from their violence; for they had by that time
retaliated the blows with which he had visited them in
their younger years; and he stated that he actually considered
his life to be in danger from his own offspring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>‘In another family, the mother possesses an excellent
development of the moral and intellectual organs, while,
in the father, the animal organs predominate in great
excess. She has been the unhappy victim of ceaseless
misfortune, originating from the misconduct of her husband.
Some of the children have inherited the father’s
brain, and some the mother’s; and of the sons whose
heads resembled the father’s, several have died through
mere debauchery and profligacy under thirty years of
age; whereas, those who resemble the mother are alive
and little contaminated, even amidst all the disadvantages
of evil example.</p>

<p>‘On the other hand, I am not acquainted with a single
instance in which the moral and intellectual organs
predominated in size, in both father and mother, and
whose external circumstances also permitted their general
activity, in which the <em>whole</em> children did not partake
of a moral and intellectual character, differing slightly
in degrees of excellence one from another, but all presenting
the decided predominance of the human over
the animal faculties.</p>

<p>‘There are well-known examples of the children of
religious and moral fathers exhibiting dispositions of a
very inferior description; but in all of these instances
that I have been able to observe, there has been a large
development of the animal organs in the one parent,
which was just controlled, but not much more, by the
moral and intellectual powers; and in the other parent,
the <em>moral</em> organs did not appear to be in large proportion.
The unfortunate child inherited the large animal
development of the one, with the defective moral development
of the other; and, in this way, was inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to both. The way to satisfy one’s self on this point,
is to examine the heads of the parents. In all such cases,
a large base of the brain, which is the region of the
animal propensities, will very probably be found in one
or other of them.</p>

<p>‘Another organic law of the animal kingdom deserves
attention; viz. that by which marriages betwixt blood
relations tend decidedly to the deterioration of the physical
and mental qualities of the offspring. In Spain, kings
marry their nieces, and, in this country, first and second
cousins marry without scruple; although every philosophical
physiologist will declare that this is in direct
opposition to the institutions of nature. This law holds
also in the vegetable kingdom. “A provision, of a very
simple kind, is, in some cases, made to prevent the male
and female blossoms of the same plant from breeding
together, this being found to hurt the breed of vegetables,
just as breeding in and in does the breed of animals.
It is contrived, that the dust shall be shed by the
male blossom before the female is ready to be affected
by it, so that the impregnation must be performed by
the dust of some other plant, and in this way the breed
be crossed.”’</p>

<p>Such considerations, I hope, will induce you to exercise
cautious examination of this subject, if either of you
should ever be placed in circumstances to contemplate
assuming the duties of the wedded life. If you do not,
you will have cast the pursuit of happiness upon the die
of chance at the very outset of your career. Allow me,
before I dismiss the book, from which I have already so
liberally quoted, to extract one passage more, touching
the application of the natural laws to the practical arrangements
of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>‘If a system of living and occupation were to be
framed for human beings, founded on the exposition of
their nature, which I have now given, it would be something
like this.</p>

<p>‘1st. So many hours a day would require to be dedicated
by every individual in health, to the exercise of
his nervous and muscular systems, in labor calculated to
give scope to these functions. The reward of obeying
this requisite of his nature would be health, and a joyous
animal existence; the punishment of neglect is disease,
low spirits and death.</p>

<p>‘2dly. So many hours a day should be spent in the
sedulous employment of the knowing and reflecting faculties;
in studying the qualities of external objects, and
their relations; also the nature of all animated beings,
and their relations; not with the view of accumulating
mere abstract and barren knowledge, but of enjoying the
positive pleasure of mental activity, and of turning every
discovery to account, as a means of increasing happiness,
or alleviating misery. The leading object should
always be to find out the relationship of every object to
our own nature, organic, animal, moral, and intellectual,
and to keep that relationship habitually in mind, so as to
render our acquirements directly gratifying to our various
faculties. The reward of this conduct would be an
incalculably great increase of pleasure, in the very act
of acquiring knowledge of the real properties of external
objects, together with a great accession of power in
reaping ulterior advantages, and in avoiding disagreeable
affections.</p>

<p>‘3dly. So many hours a day ought to be devoted to the
cultivation and gratification of our moral sentiments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that is to say, in exercising these in harmony with intellect,
and especially in acquiring the habit of admiring,
loving, and yielding obedience to the Creator and his
institutions. This last object is of vast importance. Intellect
is barren of practical fruit, however rich it may be
in knowledge, until it is fired and prompted to act by moral
sentiment. In my view, knowledge by itself is comparatively
worthless and impotent, compared with what
it becomes when vivified by elevated emotions. It is
not enough that intellect is informed; the moral faculties
must simultaneously cooperate; yielding obedience to
the precepts which the intellect recognises to be true.
One way of cultivating the sentiments would be for men
to meet and act together, on the fixed principles which
I am now endeavoring to unfold, and to exercise on each
other in mutual instruction, and in united adoration of
the great and glorious Creator, the several faculties of
Benevolence, Veneration, Hope, Ideality, Wonder, and
Justice. The reward of acting in this manner would be
a communication of direct and intense pleasure to each
other; for I refer to every individual who has ever had
the good fortune to pass a day or an hour with a really
benevolent, pious, honest, and intellectual man, whose
soul swelled with adoration of his Creator, whose intellect
was replenished with knowledge of his works, and
whose whole mind was instinct with sympathy for human
happiness, whether such a day did not afford him the
most pure, elevated, and lasting gratification he ever enjoyed.
Such an exercise, besides, would invigorate the
whole moral and intellectual powers, and fit them to discover
and obey the divine institutions.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>You will study, and obey the moral laws of the universe,
of which you are a part, because you are moral
beings, and because obedience to these laws constitutes
the tie of affinity between you, the higher orders of
being and the divinity. You will respect them, because
it is the glory of your nature, that you alone, of all creatures
below, are morally subject to them. Laying out
of the question their momentous sanctions in the eternal
future, you must be aware, that the Creator has annexed
pleasure to obeying them, and pain to their violation
as inevitably, as gravity belongs to matter. One would
think, it must be enough to determine the conduct of a
being, who laid claim to the character of rational, to
know, that no art nor dexterity, that no repentance nor
return to obedience, can avert the consequences of a
single violation of these laws; and that no imaginable
present good can counterbalance the future misery, that
must accrue in consequence.</p>

<p>In regard, for example, to the practice of the most
common and every day duties, who can doubt the truth
of the trite adage, <em>honesty is the best policy</em>? This is, in
effect, no more than saying, that the moral laws of the
universe are constituted upon such principles, as to make
it every man’s interest to obey them. It is as certain,
that they are so constituted, as that fire will burn, or
water drown you; and when you understand this constitution,
it marks the same want of a sane mind to violate
them, as to be unable to keep out of these elements.
Yet the greater portion of the species do not constantly
act upon a full belief in this hackneyed maxim. They
think apparently, that they can in some way obtain the
imagined advantage of dishonesty and evade the connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
evil, not aware, that detection and diminished confidence
may be avoided, for once or twice; but not the
loss of self-respect, the pureness and integrity of internal
principle, the certainty of forging the first link in a chain
of bad habits, and a thousand painful consequences,
which it would be easy to enumerate in detail. Almost
every one deems that he may safely put forth every day
false compliment, double-dealing, deception on a small
scale, and little frauds, not cognisable by any law or
code of honor. In a word, if actions are a test of the
sincerity of conviction, very few really are convinced
that <em>honesty is the best policy</em>.</p>

<p>We hold the man insane who should leap from a high
building upon the pavement, or attempt to grapple with
the blind power of the elements. But it is scarcely the
subject of our remark, that the multitude about us, in
the most important, as well as the minute concerns of
life, live in habitual recklessness or violation of the
organic and moral laws; and yet we certainly know, that
whoever infringes them is as sure to pay the penalty, as
he who madly places himself in opposition to the material
laws. I can never present this astonishing and universal
blindness in too many forms of repetition, if the effect is
to bring you to view these two species of folly in the
same light.</p>

<p>The reason clearly is, that in too many instances, men
take no pains to acquaint themselves with these laws,
and their bearing upon the constitution of man; or, deceived
by the clamors of the inclinations, and the illusions
of present pleasure and advantage, when balanced with
future and remote penalties, they commit the infractions,
and hope, that between the certain pleasure and the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and contingent pain, they can interpose some evasion,
and sever the consequences from the fault. The expectation
always ends, like the alchymist’s dream, and
the projector’s perpetual motion. Even in the apprehension
of the consequences, the mind is paying the
penalty of an unquiet conscience, and of an abatement
of self-confidence, and self-respect, penalties, which
very few earthly pleasures can compensate.</p>

<p>When I speak of these unchangeable laws, as emanations
from the divine wisdom and goodness, as transcripts
of the divine immutability, and as being the best
of all possible arrangements, not to be superseded, or
turned from their course by the wisest of beings, you
will not understand me to bear upon the consoling and
scriptural doctrine of providence. I firmly believe, and
trust in it; not, however, in the popular view. It would
not increase my veneration for the Almighty, to suppose
that his laws required exceptions and variations, to meet
particular cases; nor that they would call for frequent
suspensions and changes, to provide for contingencies
not foreseen at the commencement of the mighty movements.
Such are not the grounds of my trust in the
wisdom and goodness of the Supreme Being. I neither
desire, nor expect any deviation of laws, as wise and
good as they can be, in their general operation, to meet
my particular wishes, or those of the friends most dear
to me. I expect, that none of the powers of nature
will change for me; I encourage no insane hopes, that
things will forego their tendencies to meet my conveniences
or pleasures. Prayer is a duty equally comforting
and elevating; but my prayers are not, that these
fixed laws of the divine wisdom may change for me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
but that I may understand and conform to them. The
providence, in which I believe, supposes no exceptions,
infringements, or violations of the universal plan of the
divine government. Miracles only seem such to us,
because we see but a link or two in the endless chain of
that plan. An ingenious mechanician constructs a
clock, which will run many years, and only once in the
whole period strike an alarm bell. It is a miracle to
those who comprehend not, that it was part of the original
plan of the mechanician. May we not with more
probability adopt the same reasoning, in relation to the
recorded miracles, as parts of the original plan of the
Eternal?</p>

<p>Piety, established upon a knowledge of these laws,
and a respect for them, and associated with veneration
for their author, is rational, consistent, firm and manly.
It seeks, it expects nothing in the puerile presumption,
that the ordinances of a code, fitted for the whole system
of the Creator, will be wrested to the wants of an
insect. In docility and meekness it labors for conformity
to those ordinances; in other words, to the divine will.
It violates no principle, and calls for the exercise of no
faith, that is repugnant to the dictates of common sense,
and the teaching of common observation. Piety,
founded on such views, abides the scrutiny of the
severest investigation. No vacillation of the mind from
varying fortunes, no questionings of unbelief, doubt and
despair, can shake it. It rests firmly on the basis of
the divine attributes. It holds fast to the golden chain,
the last link of which is riveted to the throne of the
Eternal.</p>

<p>Thus it seems to me indispensable, as a pre-requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to the pursuit of happiness, that the inquirer should hold
large discourse with the physical, organic and moral
laws; that he should carefully investigate their whole
bearing upon his constitution; that he should trace all
their influences on him from the first hour, in which he
opens his eyes on the light, to his departure out of life.
I insist the more earnestly upon this, because in these
days the study of the moral relations of things seems to
me comparatively abandoned. The exact and natural
sciences are studied, rather, it would seem, as an end,
than a means. Natural philosophy, mathematics and
astronomy may be highly useful; but who will compare
these sciences, in regard to their utility and importance,
with those, which guide the mind to their author, which
teach the knowledge of his moral laws, which instruct
us how to allay the passions, to moderate our expectations,
and to establish morality on the basis of our regard
to our own happiness?</p>

<p>If, then, you would give yourself to the patient study
of the natural sciences, that you may gain reputation
and the ability to be useful, much more earnestly will
you study regimen, exercise, temperance, moderation,
cheerfulness, the benefits of a balanced mind, and of a
wise and philosophic conformity to an order of things,
not a tittle of which you can change, that you may be
resigned, useful and happy. All knowledge, which cannot
be turned to this account, either as relates to yourselves,
or others, is useless.</p>

<p>Innumerable counsels, in relation to your habits, your
pleasures and pursuits, your studies, your tastes and
modes of conduct, your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of natural and moral
beauty, your standard of dignity and worth of character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
press upon my mind, and all in some way connected
with the views, which I have just taken. But I shall
be able to present such of them as I may deem worthy
to find a place in these letters, perhaps with most propriety
and effect, as suggested in the form of notes<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
appended to the chapters of the essay of M. Droz, a
paraphrase of which I now offer you.</p>

<span class="fs70">GENERAL VIEWS OF THE SUBJECT.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Man is created to be happy.<a name="NOTEanchor_1" id="NOTEanchor_1"></a><a href="#NOTE_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His desires and the
wisdom of the Creator concur to prove the assertion.
Yet the earth resounds with the complaints of the unhappy,
although they are encompassed with the means
of enjoyment, of which they appear to know neither
the value nor the use. They resemble the shipwrecked
mariner, on a desert isle, surrounded with fruits, of the
flavors and properties of which he is ignorant, as he is
doubtful whether they offer aliment or poison.</p>

<p>I was early impelled to investigate the character and
motives of the crowd around me, eagerly rushing forward
in pursuit of happiness. I soon noted multitudes
relinquishing the chase in indolent despondency. They
affirmed to me that they no longer believed in the existence
of happiness. I felt an insatiate craving, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
saw life through the illusive coloring of youth. Unwilling
to resign my hopes, I inquired of others, who seemed
possessed of greater strength of mind, and more weight
of character, if they could guide me to the place of
happiness? Some answered with an ill-concealed smile
of derision, and others with bitterness. They declared
that in their view the pleasures of life were more than
counterbalanced by its pains. Because they were disappointed
and discouraged, they deemed that their
superior wisdom had enabled them to strip off the disguises
of life, and contemplate it with sullen resignation.</p>

<p>I remarked others in high places, whose restless
activity and brilliance dazzled the multitude and inspired
envy. I eagerly asked of them the secret of happiness.
Too proud and self-satisfied to dissemble, they made
little effort to conceal their principles. I saw their
hearts contracted by the vileness of egotism, and devoured
with measureless ambition. A faithful scrutiny,
which penetrated beyond their dazzling exterior, showed
me the righteous reaction of their principles, and convinced
me that they suffered according to their deserts.</p>

<p>Weary and disheartened, I left them, and repaired to
the class of stern and austere moralists. They represented
the world to me as a melancholy and mysterious
valley, through which the sojourner passes, groaning on
his way to the grave. Their doctrines inspired me at
once with sadness and terror. I soon resumed the elastic
confidence of youth, and replied, ‘I will never
believe that the Author of my being, who has imaged in
my heart such pure and tranquil pleasures, who has
rendered man capable of chaste love, and of friendship
in its sanctity, who has formed us innocent before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
could practise virtue, and who has connected the salutary
bitterness of repentance with errors, has unalterably
willed our misery.’</p>

<p>Thence I passed to the opposite extreme, and
accosted a gay and reckless throng, whose deportment
showed that they had found the object of my pursuit.
I discovered them to be fickle by character, and vacillating
from indifference. They had only escaped the
errors of the moralists, by substituting, in place of their
austere maxims, enjoyments without any regard to consequences.
I asked them to point me to happiness.
Without comprehending the import of my question, they
offered me participation in their pleasures. But I saw
them prodigal of life, dissipating years in a few days,
and reserving the remnant of their existence for unavailing
repentance.<a name="NOTEanchor_2" id="NOTEanchor_2"></a><a href="#NOTE_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In view of so many observations, I abandoned the idea
of guiding my researches by the counsels of others;
and began to inquire for the secret in my own bosom.
I heard the multitude around me complaining, in disappointment
and discouragement. I resolved, that I would
not commence the pursuit of happiness by servilely following
in their beaten path. I determined to reflect,
and patiently investigate a subject of so much moment.
I detected at once the error of the common impression,
that pleasure and happiness are the same. The former,
fickle and fleeting, assumes forms as various as human
caprice; and its most attractive charm is novelty. The
object which gives it birth today, ceases to please, or
inspires disgust tomorrow. The perception of happiness
is not thus changeable and transient. It creates
the consciousness of an existence so tranquil and satisfying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that the longer we experience it, the more we
desire to prolong its duration.</p>

<p>Another mistaken, though common impression is, that
the more profoundly we reflect, and make the pursuit
of happiness a study, the less we shall be likely to enjoy.
This is an error not only in regard to happiness, but
even pleasure. If it be innocent and exempt from
danger, to analyze it, and reason upon it, so far from
diminishing, prolongs the delight, and renders it higher.
Without reflection we only skim its surface; we do not
penetrate, and enjoy it.</p>

<p>Let us observe the few, who have acquired the wisdom
to enjoy that existence, which the multitude waste.
In their festal unions of friendship, let us mark the
development of their desire to multiply the happy moments
of life. By what ingenious and pleasant discussions
do they heighten the charms of their condition! With
what delicacy of tact do they analyze their enjoyments,
to taste them with a more prolonged and exquisite
relish! With what skill do they discipline themselves
sometimes to efface the images of the future, that nothing
may embitter, or distract their relish of the present; and
sometimes to invoke remembrances and hopes, to impart
to it still brighter embellishments!</p>

<p>Contrary to the prevalent impression, I therefore
deem that, to reflect much upon it, is one of the wisest
means in the pursuit of happiness. The first analysis of
reflection, it is true, dispels the charm with which
youth invests existence. It forces the conviction upon
us, that the pleasures of life are less durable, and its
forms more numerous and prolonged, than we had anticipated.
The first result of the process is discouragement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
But, as we continue to reflect, objects change
their aspect a second time. The evils which at the
first glance seemed so formidable, lose a portion of their
terrific semblance; and the fleeting pleasures of existence
receive new attractions from their analogy to human
weakness.</p>

<p>They mistake, too, who suppose that the art on which
I write has never been taught. The sages of Greece investigated
the science of happiness as eloquently and
profoundly, as they studied the other sciences. They
wisely held the latter in estimation only so far as they
were subservient to the former. In all succeeding ages
there have arisen a few thinking men, who have regarded
all their faculties, their advantages of nature and fortune,
their studies and acquirements, not as ends in
themselves, but as means conducive to the right pursuit
of happiness.</p>

<p>So long a period has elapsed since this has been a
subject of investigation, that when the opinion is advanced
that this pursuit may be successfully conducted
by system, its rules reduced to an art, and thus become
assimilated to those of the other arts, most men are
utterly incredulous.<a name="NOTEanchor_3" id="NOTEanchor_3"></a><a href="#NOTE_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> No truth, however, is more simple.
To attain to a knowledge of the rules, it is only
requisite, as in the other arts, that there should be natural
dispositions for the study, favorable circumstances, and
an assiduous investigation of the precepts.</p>

<p>The influence of fortunate dispositions for this study
is chiefly discernible in men of marked and energetic
character. Some are endowed by nature with such
firmness and force of character, that misfortune cannot
shake them. It slides, if I may so speak, over the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of their stoical hearts, and the shock of adversity
inspires them almost with a sort of pleasure, calling forth
the conscious feeling of power and independence for
resistance. But we observe the greater number shrinking
from affliction, and even images of sadness, enjoying
the present without apparent consciousness, and forgetting
the past without regret. Always fickle and frivolous,
they evade suffering by recklessness and gayety.
The most perfect organization for happiness<a name="NOTEanchor_4" id="NOTEanchor_4"></a><a href="#NOTE_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> imparts
at the same time great force to resist the pains of life,
and keen sensibility to enjoy its pleasures. I am aware
that great energy and quick sensibility are generally
supposed to be incompatible qualities; I have, nevertheless,
often seen them united. I would lay down
precepts, by which to obtain the combination. By a
more perfect education, it is hoped that, in the ages to
come, this union may become general.</p>

<p>Perhaps some will ask, if he who thus assumes to
teach the art of happiness has himself learned to be
constantly happy? Endowed with a moderate share of
philosophy, and aided by favorable circumstances, I have
thus far found the pleasures of life greatly overbalancing
its pains. But who can hope felicity without alloy? I
would not conceal that I have had my share of inquietudes
and regrets; and I have sometimes forgotten my
principles. I resemble the pilot, who gives lessons
upon his art after more than one shipwreck.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_V" id="LETTER_V"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LETTER V.</a><br /><br />

<span class="fs70">OUR DESIRES.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Whence are our most common sufferings? From
desires which surpass our ability to satisfy them. The ancients
relate, that Oromazes appeared to Usbeck, the
virtuous, and said, ‘form a wish, and I will grant it.’
‘Source of light,’ replied the sage, ‘I only wish to limit
my desires by those things, which nature has rendered
indispensable.’<a name="NOTEanchor_6" id="NOTEanchor_6"></a><a href="#NOTE_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Let us not suppose, however, that a negative happiness,
a condition exempt from suffering, is the most
fortunate condition to which we may aspire. They
who contend for this gloomy system, have but poorly
studied the nature of man. If he errs in desiring positive
enjoyments, if his highest aim ought to be, to live free
from pain, the caves of the forest conceal those happy
beings whom we ought to choose for our models.</p>

<p>Bounded by the present, animals sleep, eat, procreate,
live without inquietude, and die without regret: and
this is the perfection of negative happiness. Man, it is
true, loses himself in vain projects. His long remembrances,
his keen foresight create him suffering in the
past and the future. His imagination brings forth errors,
his liberty, crimes. But the abuse of his faculties
does not disprove their excellence. Let him consecrate
to directing them aright, that time which he has hitherto
lost in mourning over their aberrations, and he will
have reason to be grateful to the Creator, for having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
given him the most exalted rank among sublunary
beings. If, on the other hand, he chooses to abandon
that rank, of which he ought to be proud, he
will degrade his immortal nature at his own cost; and
will only add to his other evils the shame of wishing to
render himself vile.</p>

<p>Let us examine those animals, the instincts of which
have the nearest relation to intelligence. Not one of
them takes possession of the paternal heritage, increases
it, and transmits it to posterity. Man alone does this, improves
his condition and his kind, and in this is essentially
distinct from all other beings below. From the Eternal
to him, and from him to animals the chain is twice
broken.</p>

<p>For man, the absence of suffering and a negative happiness
are not sufficient. His noble faculties refuse the
repose of indifference. Created to aspire to whatever
may be an element of enjoyment, let him cherish his
desires, and let them indicate to him the path of happiness;
too fortunate, if they do not entice him towards
objects, which retire in proportion as he struggles to
attain them, and towards those imaginary joys, of which
the deceitful possession is more fertile in regrets than
in pleasures.</p>

<p>Far from being the austere censor of desires, I admit,
that they often produce charming illusions. What loveliness
have they not spread over our spring of life! Our
imagination at that time, as brilliant and as vivid as our
age, embellished the whole universe, and every position in
which our lot might one day place us. We were occupied
with errors; but they were happy errors; and to
desire was to enjoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Those enchanting dreams, which hold such a delightful
place in the life of every man, whose imagination is
gay and creative, spring from our desires. Ingenious
fictions! Prolific visions! While ye cradle us, we possess
the object of our magic reveries. Real possession
may be less fugitive. But may it not also vanish like a
dream?</p>

<p>Doubtless there are dangers blended with these seductive
imaginings. In leaving the region of illusion, the
greater part of men look with regret upon the abodes of
reality, in which they must henceforward dwell. Let
us not share their gloomy weakness. Let us learn to
enjoy the moments of error, and perpetuate and renew
them by remembrance. Children, only, are allowed to
weep, when the waking moment dispels the toys, of
which a dream had given them possession.</p>

<p>We give ourselves up to illusions without danger, if
we have formed our reason; if we wisely think that the
situation where our lot has placed us may have advantages
which no other could offer. Imagination embellishes
some hours without troubling any. Prompt to
yield to the delightful visions, there are few of which I
have not contemplated the charm. In seeing them vanish
like a fleeting dream, I look round on my wife and
children, and believe that I am remembered by a few
friends. I open my heart to the pleasures of my retreat,
which, though simple, are ever new. As the gilded
creations of imagination disappear, I smile at my creative
occupation, and console myself with the consciousness,
that fancy can paint nothing brighter or more satisfying,
than these my realities.<a name="NOTEanchor_7" id="NOTEanchor_7"></a><a href="#NOTE_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But let me hasten to make an important distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to prevent the semblance of contradiction. Let me
discriminate those fleeting desires, which amuse, or delude
us for a moment, from those deep cravings, which,
directing all our faculties towards a given end, necessarily
exercise a strong influence upon life. It is time to contemplate
the latter, and to suggest more grave reflections.
While the scope of our faculties is limited to narrow
bounds, our desires run out into infinity. From this
fact result two reflections&mdash;the one afflicting, that the
multitude are miserable, because it is easier to form,
than to obtain our wishes; the other consoling, that
they might be happy, since every one can regulate his
desires.</p>

<p>Reduced to the necessity to realize, or restrain them,
which course does wisdom indicate? Will ambition conduct
us to repose?<a name="NOTEanchor_8" id="NOTEanchor_8"></a><a href="#NOTE_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He who chases its phantoms, resembles
the child who imagines that he shall be able
to grasp the rainbow, which spans the mountain in the
distance. But from mountain to mountain, a new horizon
spreads before his eyes. But the courage and
perseverance requisite to regulate our desires, may intimidate
us. We vex ourselves in the pursuit of fortune,
honor and glory. Philosophy is worth more than the
whole, and do we expect to purchase it without pain?
True, she declares to us, that to realize our desires is a
part of the science of happiness; but by no means the
most important one. Yet it is the only one to which
most men devote themselves. Philosophy should teach
us, what desires we ought to receive and cherish, as
inmates. When they are fleeting and spring from a gay
and creative imagination, let us yield ourselves without
fear to their transient dreams. But when they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
exercise a long and decisive influence, let a mature examination
teach us, whether wisdom allows the attempt
to realize them. Oh! how much uncertainty and torment
we might spare our weakness, if from infancy we
directed our pursuit towards the essential objects of
felicity, and if we stripped those, which, in their issue,
produce chimerical hopes and bitter regrets, of their
deceitful charms! What gratitude should we not owe
that provident instruction, whose cares should indicate,
and smooth our road to happiness! The great results,
which might be obtained from education, would be, to
moderate the desires, and to find some indemnities for
the sorrows of life. On the present plan, by arousing
our emulation, by enkindling our instinctive ardor to
increase our fortune, and eclipse our rivals, we make it
a study, if I may so say, to render ourselves discontented
with our destiny; and, as if afraid that we should
not be sufficiently perverted by the contagion of example,
we invoke ambition and cupidity to enter the soul.
We treat as chimerical those desires, which are so simple
and pure, as to be pleasures of themselves, and which
look to a happiness easy of attainment.</p>

<p>Let us, then, unlearn most of the ideas we have received.
Let us close our eyes on the illusions which
surround us. Let us remould our plan of life, and
retain in the heart only those desires which nature has
placed there. Let reflection impart energy to our mind,
and be our guide in the new path which reason opens
before us.</p>

<p>We shall be told, that these desires animate us unsought
and continually. I admit it. But in most men
they are the simple result of instinct, and are vague, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
without decisive effect. A craving for happiness is diffused
as widely as life. The enlightened desire of happiness
is as rare as wisdom. The mass of our species
do not avail themselves of life, to enjoy it; but apparently
for other purposes. My first and fundamental
maxim is, that no one should live by chance. Enfranchised
from vulgar ideas, and guided by the principles
of true wisdom, let happiness be our end; and let us
view all our employments and pursuits, as means.</p>

<p>I meet men of sanguine temperament, who say in the
pride of internal energy, ‘my calculations must succeed.
I am certain to acquire wealth.’ Another of the same
class assures me, that he sees no turn to his rapid career
of advancement; and that he is confident of reaching
the summit of greatness. What more fortunate result
can he propose, than happiness? My pupil should make
all his plans subservient to the numbering of happy days
even from the commencement of his career.<a name="NOTEanchor_9" id="NOTEanchor_9"></a><a href="#NOTE_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Let us beware, however, of aspiring after a perfect
felicity. The art I discuss, will not descend from heaven.
Its object is, to indicate desirable situations,
to guide us towards them, when they offer, and to
remove the vexations of life. The greater part of mankind
might exist in comfort. They fail of this, in aiming
at impracticable amelioration of their condition. It
is an egregious folly only to contemplate the dark side
of our case. I deem it a mark of wisdom and strength
of mind, rather to exaggerate its advantages.</p>

<p>Let us carefully ascertain, what things are indispensable
to our well-being; and let us discipline all our desires
towards the acquisition of them. If I consult those
who are driven onward by the whirlwind of life, to learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
what objects are absolutely necessary to my end, what a
long catalogue they will name! If I ask moralists, how
many sacrifices, incompatible with human nature, will
they impose! Agitated, and uncertain, I am conscious,
that my powers are equally insufficient to amass all
which the former prescribe, or to tear me from all which
the latter disdainfully interdict.</p>

<p>In examining this all important subject, without the
spirit of system, I realize, that the essentials of a happy
life are tranquillity of mind, independence, health, competence,
and the affection of some of our equals. Let
us strive to acquire them. They are numerous, I admit,
and difficult to unite in the possession of an individual.
Nevertheless, if a severe discrimination enabled
us to bound our pursuit by the desire of obtaining only
these objects, what a great and happy change would be
effected upon the earth; and how many disappointments
would be henceforward unknown!<a name="NOTEanchor_10" id="NOTEanchor_10"></a><a href="#NOTE_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_VI" id="LETTER_VI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LETTER VI.</a><br /><br />

<span class="fs70">TRANQUILLITY OF MIND.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>By the word tranquillity I designate that state of the
mind in which, estranged from the weaknesses of life,
it tastes that happy calm which it owes to its own power
and elevation. Inaccessible to storms, it still admits
those emotions which give birth to pure pleasures, and
yields to the generous movements which the virtues inspire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Tranquillity seems indifference only in the eyes
of the vulgar. A delightful consciousness of existence
accompanies it. We may meditate with a just pride
upon the causes which produce it. Without reasoning
we respire and enjoy it. It is the appropriate pleasure
of the sage.</p>

<p>A pure conscience is the profoundest source of this
delightful calm. Without it, we shall attempt in vain to
veil our faults from ourselves, or to listen only to the
voice of adulation. An interior witness must testify
that we have sometimes sought occasions to be useful;
and that we have always welcomed those who offered
us opportunities to do good.</p>

<p>Another condition equally necessary is to close the
heart against unregulated ambition. I am well aware,
in laying down this precept, that I shall be deemed an
idle dreamer. If you are convinced beyond argument
that there is nothing worth seeking in life but distinctions
and honors, you may close my book. If you are ready
to receive these brilliant illusions when they come unsought,
and return to the repose of your heart should
you obtain them not, you may pursue the reading of my
lessons.</p>

<p>Do not fear that I am about to announce trite truths
touching the vices which ambition brings in its train,
and the shameful actions and base measures by which
it proposes to elevate its aspirant. Why should I declaim
in common-place against ambition when I have
truths to offer so pressing, simple and self-evident?</p>

<p>To consecrate to true enjoyment as many days as
possible, to lose in disquieting desires as few moments
as we may, these are the elements of my philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The world, on the other hand, incessantly repeats,
‘Shine&mdash;ascend high places&mdash;bind fortune to your chariot
wheels;’ the multitude listen, and consume life in
tormenting desires which end in disappointment. I say
to my disciple, make your pursuit, whatever it be, a
source of present enjoyment, and be happy without delay.
But the cry of objection reaches me, ‘would you
wish him to vegetate in obscurity and never transcend
the limits of the narrow circle in which he was born?’
I would have him enjoy the self-respect of conscious
usefulness, and taste all the innocent pleasures of the
senses, the heart, mind and understanding. Farther
than these, I see nothing but the miserable inquietudes
of vanity. I admit that the pleasures of gratified ambition
are high flavored and intoxicating; but compelled
to choose among enjoyments which cannot all be tasted
together, I balance the delights which they spread over
life with the pains which it must cost to obtain them. If
I incline to ambition, I must fly privacy and my retreat;
and renounce the pleasures which my family, friends
and free pursuits daily renew. I must no longer inhabit
the paradise of my pleasant dreams. Abandoning the
simple and sincere enjoyments of obscurity, I abandon
repose and independence.</p>

<p>Suppose I obtain those honors of which the distant
brilliancy dazzles my vision, what destiny can I propose
to myself? How long can I enjoy my honors? Besieged
by incessant alarm, through fear of losing them,
how often shall I sigh over the ill-judged exchange by
which I bartered peace and privacy for them? Number
all the truly happy days of the ambitious&mdash;they are
those in which, forming his projects, and, in his imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
removing the obstacles that lie in his way, he embellishes
his career with the illusions of his fancy. Too
often the desired objects, which in the distance glittered
in his eyes, resemble those paintings which, seen from
afar, present enchanting scenery, but offer only revolting
views when beheld close at hand.</p>

<p>I wish to avoid the usual exaggeration upon these
subjects. Moralists deceive us when painting the contrast
between the virtues and the vices; they assign unmingled
felicity to the one, and absolute misery to the
other. I am sensible that even in his deepest inquietudes,
and notwithstanding his desires and regrets, the votary
of ambition still has his moments of intoxicating pleasure.
It is not this alone, but happiness we seek. If we
wish only to toil up the heights of ambition to enjoy the
dignities of the summit, counsels are useless. If we ask
for nothing more than pleasures, they may be varied to
infinity, and be found pervading all situations in forms
appropriate to all characters. This hypocrite, that victim
of envy, yonder miser, do they experience, the
moralist will ask, nothing but torment? Mark the
misanthrope who incessantly repeats that in a world
peopled with perverse beings and malign spirits, existence
is an odious burden. This man, notwithstanding, finds
his pleasures in a world which he affects so to detest.
Every invective which he throws out against it, is a
eulogy reflected back upon himself. He rises in his own
estimation in proportion as he debases others, and finds
in himself all the qualities which he makes them want.
Does he meet with a partisan of his principles? how delightful
for two misanthropes to communicate their discoveries,
and to make a joint war of sarcasm upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
human race! Does he find an antagonist? he experiences
a charm in controverting him. Besides, as in
vilifying human nature, no one can want either facts or
arguments to present it in hues sufficiently dark, in
the complacency of conscious triumph, he terminates
his war of words.</p>

<p>The votary of ambition not only has pleasures which
are often dazzling, but perhaps enjoyments not within
the ordinary ken, which require profound observation.
The ardent aspiration after success gives a charm to
efforts in the struggle which would otherwise present only
unmixed bitterness. Acts in themselves vile, ridiculous,
or revolting, contemplated as means essential to a proposed
end, lose their meanness and tendency to lessen
self-respect. It is possible, in this view, that even extraordinary
humiliations may inspire the ambitious with
a sort of pride, in the consciousness that he has strength to
stoop to them for his purposes. In fine, it is too true that
pleasure may be found in the most capricious aberrations,
the most shameful vices, and the most atrocious crimes.</p>

<p>It will be seen that I abandon most of the trite declamation
against ambition. I touch not on its long inquietudes,
its inevitable torments, exacerbated a hundred
fold, if their victim preserve degrees of mental elevation
and remains of moral sentiment. Life passes pleasantly
among men who have just views, upright hearts and
frank manners, the true elements of greatness and enjoyment.
Surrounded by such minds, we respire, as it
were, a free and an empyrean atmosphere. Yield yourself
to the empire of ambition; and in all countries, and
in all time, you condemn yourself to live surrounded by
greedy, unquiet, false and vindictive intriguers, gnashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
their teeth at all success in which they had no agency.
All that encircle you unite insolence and baseness.</p>

<p>Those who envy authority and office are worthy of
commiseration. Men in power are happy, they think.
They have but to wish, and it is accomplished. The
epitaph of the Swedish minister is sublime, and the index
of a great truth. He had run the career of power and
fortune with success. When near the period of his
death, he ordered this inscription for his tomb: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tandem
Felix.</i> <em>At last I am happy.</em></p>

<p>We never leave the society of the great as we entered
it. We have become either better or more perverse.
Inexperience is easily dazzled with the superficial splendor.
For a man of disciplined mind and a character
of energy, it is the most useful of schools. Here he
tests and confirms his principles. Here he observes,
sometimes with terror, sometimes with disgust, the melancholy
results of the seductive passions. He here sees
those who seem to have reached all their aims enjoying
the repose of happy privacy. I anticipate the
objection, ‘that this is all absurdity; that not one will be
so convinced of his misery as to resign his power and
descend from his elevation to that obscurity for which
he sighs.’ I believe it; and I see in this a deeper shade
in his misery. He has so long experienced the pernicious
excitement of this splendid torment, that he can no
longer exist in repose.</p>

<p>Such is the lot of erring humanity, that the world
naturally associates glory and happiness with ambition,
and sees not that the association is formed by our own
mental feebleness. To rise above vulgar errors and the
common train of thinking, to form sage principles, and,
still more, to have the courage and decision to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
them, this is the proof of real force of character. But,
to feel the need of dazzling the vulgar, to be willing to
creep in order to rise, to struggle and dispute for trinkets,
this is the common standard by which the multitude
estimate a great mind.</p>

<p>Philosophers are accused of having presented grandeur
under an unfavorable aspect in order to console themselves
for not having enjoyed it. History reads us
another lesson. Aristotle instructed the son of Philip.
Plato was received at the courts of kings. Cicero received
the title of ‘father of his country’ by a decree of
the senate. Boethius, thrice clad with the consular
purple, when his locks were hoary, was dragged to a
dungeon. He wrote ‘the consolations inspired by philosophy,’
and laid down his book at the foot of the scaffold.
Marcus Aurelius honored the throne of the world
by those modest virtues which shone still brighter in
obscurity. Fenelon was raised to the highest dignities
only to experience their bitterness, and, like his great
predecessor, to owe his glory and his happy days only
to wisdom and retirement. Franklin will be remembered
in all time, not as the governor, legislator and ambassador,
but as having trained himself to his admirable
philosophy of common sense amidst the laborious occupations
of a printer.</p>

<p>The certainty of acquiring the self-respect of conscious
usefulness, a certainty which the great can seldom
have, ought alone to determine a wise man to quit his
obscurity. But if the emoluments and honors of a high
station seduce us, let us value our independence and let
us not exchange treasures for tinsel.</p>

<p>We have freedom to avoid every culpable action, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to contemplate with pity the chimeras of ambition. Let
us see if in misfortune we can preserve tranquillity of
mind.</p>

<span class="fs70">OF MISFORTUNE.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>If we wish our precepts to be followed, we must
avoid the extremes to which moralists and philosophers
are too much inclined to press their doctrines, for they
are impracticable in real life. It is useless to deny that
there are evils against which the aids of reason and
friendship are powerless. Let us leave him who is
about to lose a being whose life is blended with his own,
to groan unreproved. Time alone can enfeeble his remembrances
and assuage his pain. To render man inaccessible
to suffering would be to change his nature.
Those austere moralists who treat our feebleness with
disdain, and who would render us indifferent to the
most terrible blows of destiny, would at the same time
leave us no sensibility to taste pleasure. Nothing can
be more absurd than the vain harangues by which common-place
consolation is offered to those who mourn a
wife, a child, a friend. All reasonings are ineffectual
when opposed to these words, ‘I have lost the loved one.
You inform me that my misfortune is without a remedy.
Oh! if there were a remedy, instead of unavailing tears,
I would employ it. It is precisely because there is none,
that I grieve.’ ‘Your tears are useless.’ ‘Still they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
serve to solace me.’ ‘God has done it.’ ‘True, and
God has formed my heart to suffer from his blow.’
‘Your child is happy, and knew neither the errors nor
the sorrows of life.’ ‘A parent’s instinctive love inspired
the desire that I might teach it to avoid both and obtain
happiness.’ ‘In the course of a long career your friend
gave an example of all the virtues.’ ‘It is because the
loss of these virtues is irreparable to me that I must deplore
his death.’<a name="NOTEanchor_11" id="NOTEanchor_11"></a><a href="#NOTE_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The greater portion of men, I admit, exaggerating
their regrets, pay a tribute of dissembled grief rather to
opinion, than to nature; and cold declamation and
frivolous distractions are sufficient to console them. But
the orators of consolation sometimes press their lessons
on hearts which are really bleeding. Let such groan
at liberty, and attempt not to contradict nature. Solitude
may exalt the imagination; but it also inspires consoling
ideas. In the silence of its refuge the desolate
mourner brings himself to a nearer communion with
him he regrets. He invokes, sees, and addresses him.
Grief is more ingenious than we imagine in finding consolation,
and has learned to employ different remedies
according as the wounds are slight or deep. Two persons
have each lost a dear friend. The one studiously
avoids the places where he used to meet his friend. The
other repairs to his desolate haunts, and surrounding
himself by monuments associated with his memory, he
seeks, if I may so say, to restore him to life.</p>

<p>The death of a beloved wife is, perhaps, the most inconsolable
of evils. Let this follow a series of other misfortunes,
and it so effaces their remembrance that the
sufferer feels he has not until then known real grief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
But if this affliction be one under which our strength
is broken, let it be the only one to obtain this fatal
triumph. Under all other misfortunes we may find in
ourselves resources for sustaining them; and may invariably
either evade or assuage them, or mitigate their
bitterness by resignation.</p>

<p>Moralists have expatiated upon the manner in which
a sage ought to contemplate the evils of life. Instead
of subscribing to their trite maxims, often more imposing
than practicable, I sketch a summary of my philosophy.
I caution the feeble and erring beings that surround
me, not to dream of unmixed happiness. I invite
them to partake promptly of all innocent pleasures. The
evils too often appended to them may follow. Know
nothing of those which have no existence except in
opinion. Struggle with courage to escape all that may
be evaded. But if it become inevitable to meet them,
let resignation, closing your eyes on the past, secure the
repose of patient endurance when happiness exists for
you no longer.</p>

<p>Permit me to give these ideas some development.
If I may believe the most prevalent modern philosophy,
tranquillity of mind is the result of organization, or temperament,
and of circumstances. It is the burden of my
inculcation, that it may be of our own procuring; and
that we owe it still more to the masculine exercise of
our reason, discipline, and mental energy, than to our
temperament or condition.</p>

<p>We have reason to deplore that unhappy being, who,
yielding to dreams of pleasure, forgets to forearm himself
against a fatal awakening. The history of great
political convulsions, and, more than all, that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
French revolution furnishes impressive examples of this
spectacle. It offers more than one instance, in the
feebler sex, of persons, who seemed created only to respire
happiness. To the advantages of youth, talent and
beauty, were united the most exalted rank, and wealth,
pleasure and power, apparently to the extent of their
wishes. To the dazzling fascination, with which a brilliant
crowd surrounded their inexperience, many of
them united the richer domestic enjoyments of the wife
and mother. In the midst of their illusions, the revolutionary
shout struck their ear, like a thunderstroke.
Executioners bade them ascend the scaffold.<a name="NOTEanchor_12" id="NOTEanchor_12"></a><a href="#NOTE_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>These great catastrophes, I know, are rare. But
there will never cease to be sorrows, which will receive
their last bitterness only in death. They are all too
painful to be sustained, unless they have been wisely
foreseen. Let us think of misfortune, as of certain
characters, with whom our lot may one day compel us
to consort.</p>

<p>It is novelty alone, which gives our emotions extreme
keenness. Whoever has strength of character, may learn
to endure anything. The red men of the American wilderness
are most impressive examples of this truth.
Time, however, is the most efficacious teacher of the
lesson of endurance. Poussin, in his painting of Eudomidas,
has delineated the human heart with fidelity.
The young girl of the piece abandons herself to despair.
Half stretched upon the earth, her head falls supinely on
the knees of the aged mother of the dying. This mother
is sitting. Her attitude announces mingled meditation
and grief. Amidst her tears, we trace firmness on
her visage. One of the two women is taking her first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
lesson of misery. The other has already passed through
a long apprenticeship of grief.<a name="NOTEanchor_13" id="NOTEanchor_13"></a><a href="#NOTE_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Reflection imparts anticipated experience. It takes
from misery that air of novelty, which renders it terrible.
When a wise man experiences a reverse, his new position
has been foreseen. He has measured the sorrows,
and prepared the consolations. Into whatever scene of
trial he is brought, he will show in no one the embarrassment
of a stranger.</p>

<p>Taught to be conscious that we are feeble combatants,
thrown upon an arena of strife, let us not calculate
that destiny has no blows in store for us. Let us
prepare for wounds, painful and slow to heal. Let us
blunt the darts of misfortune in advance. Then, if they
strike they will not penetrate so deep. But in premeditating
the trials, which may be in reserve for our courage,
let not anticipated solicitude disturb the present.
Of all mental efforts, foresight is the most difficult to
regulate. If we have it not, we fall into reverses unprepared.
If we exercise it too far, we are perpetually
miserable by anticipation.</p>

<p>The philosopher prepares himself for contingent
perils by processes which impart a keener pleasure to
present enjoyment. He better understands the value of
the moments of joy, and learns to dispel the fears,
which might mar their tranquillity. That is a gloomy
wisdom, which condemns the precepts that invite us to
draw, from the uncertainty of our lot, a motive to embellish
the moment of actual happiness. Transient
beings, around whom everything is changing and in motion,
adopt my maxims. Let us aid those who surround
us, to put them in practice. Let us render those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
are happy today more happy. Tomorrow the opportunity
may have passed forever.</p>

<p>As though nature had not sowed sufficient sorrows in
our path during our short career, we have added to the
mass by our own invention. The offspring of our vanity
and puerile prejudices, these factitious pains seem
sometimes more difficult to support, than real evils. A
warrior, who has shown fearless courage in the deadly
breach, has passed a sleepless night, because he was
not invited to a party, or a feast; or because a riband,
or a diploma has not been added to the many, with
which he is already decorated. I had been informed,
that the wife and son of a distinguished acquaintance
were dangerously sick. I met him pale, and thoughtful.
I was meditating, how to give him hope in regard to the
objects of his supposed anxiety. While I was hesitating
how to address him, he made known the subject of his
real inquietude. He was in expectation of a high employment.
The man of power, in whose hand was the
gift, had just received him coldly a second time. He
was anxiously calculating his remaining chances, and
striving to divine the causes of his discouraging reception.</p>

<p>To avoid such ridiculous agonies, let us adopt a maxim,
not the less true, because the phrase, in which I
express it, may seem trivial. Three quarters and half
the remaining quarter of our vexations are not worth
wasting a thought upon their cause. I add, that even
in expectations which appear important, we ought to
fear trusting too little to chance. The order of events,
which we call by this name, is often more sage than
any that human calculation can arrange. If it decides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in a manner which at first view seems greatly against us,
let us defer our accusations, until we have more thoroughly
tested the event. I have met a man, who had long
been an aspirant for a certain place, with a radiant countenance,
having just obtained it. Three months afterwards,
he would have purchased at any price the power
of recalling events. I have seen another friend in desolation,
because he could not obtain the hand of the
daughter of a man, whose enterprises promised an immense
fortune. He had been rejected. The speculations
of her father all failed; and the reputation of his
integrity and good faith with them. The despairing
lover would have shared the poverty and disgrace of a
helpless family; and would have been tormented, besides,
with an incompatible union, of itself sufficient to
have rendered him miserable in the midst of all the expected
prosperity. One event is contemplated with a
charmed eye; another with despair. The issue alone
can declare, which of the two we ought to have desired.</p>

<p>I grant, that we are surrounded by real dangers. I
pretend not to be above suffering; and I attach no merit
to becoming the reckless dupe of men or chance.
The highest philosophy is at the same time the most simple
and practicable. There is no error more common
than one, which is taken for profound wisdom. Most
men look too deep for the springs of events, and the
motives of action. In many alternatives, we shall be
most wise in giving the reins to chance. When we are
menaced by an evident peril, let us summon all our
energy, and courageously struggle to ward it off. If,
after all, neither wisdom can evade it, nor bravery vanquish it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
let us see, how true wisdom ordains us to sustain
it.</p>

<p>How many are ignorant of the value of resignation,
or confound it with weakness! The courage of resignation
is, perhaps, the most high and rare of all the forms
of that virtue. Man received the gift directly from the
Author of his being. His desires, inquietudes, misguided
opinions, the fruits of an ambitious and incongruous
education, have weakened its force in the soul. Who
can read the anecdote of the American wilderness without
thrilling emotion? An Indian, descending the Niagara
river, was drawn into the rapids above the sublime
cataract. The nursling of the desert rowed with incredible
vigor at first, in an intense struggle for life.
Seeing his efforts useless, he dropped his oars, sung his
death song, and floated in calmness down the abyss.
His example is worthy of imitation. While there is
hope, let us nerve all our force, to avail ourselves of all
the chances it suggests. When hope ceases, and the
peril must be braved, wisdom counsels calm resignation.<a name="NOTEanchor_14" id="NOTEanchor_14"></a><a href="#NOTE_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In regard to unconquerable evils, the true doctrine is
not vain resistance, but profound submission. It conceals
the outline of what we have to suffer, as with a
veil. It hastens to bring us the fruit of consoling time.
It opens our eyes to a clearer view of the possessions
which remain to us. It precedes hope, as twilight
ushers in the day.</p>

<p>It is by laying down certain well ascertained principles
of conduct, and re-examining them every day, that a
new empire is given to reason, and that we learn to select
the most eligible point in all situations in life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Greek philosophers were, incontestably, the men, who
best understood the art of becoming happy. Their
studies led them to the unwearied contemplation of the
true good, the advantages of elevation of mind, the danger
of the passions, and a calm submission to inevitable
ills. Such were the habitual subjects of their meditations
and discourses. They suffered less from the
evils of life, only because they cultivated habits of profound
reflection.</p>

<p>Among the moderns, in pursuit of happiness, some
study only to multiply their physical enjoyments; and
limited to gross sensations, differ little from brutes, except
in discoursing about what they eat. Others,
higher in the scale of thought, cultivate the pleasures
of literature and the fine arts. But disciplining but a
single class of their powers, with a view to distinguish
themselves from the vulgar, they are not always more
happy. True philosophy is chiefly conversant about
that kind of acquisition, which preëminently constitutes
the rational man, forms his reason, and places him, as a
master, in the midst of an unreflecting world surrounded
by children full of ignorance and fatuity.</p>

<span class="fs70">OF INDEPENDENCE.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>We distinguish many kinds of liberty. That which
we owe to equal laws, without being indispensable to a
philosopher, renders the attainment of happiness more
easy to him. However men differ in their political
opinions, they all have an instinctive desire to be free.
Every one is reluctant and afraid to submit himself to
the capricious power of those about him. The thirst of
power is only another form of this ardor for independence.</p>

<p>With what interest we read in history of those ignorant
tribes, unknown to fame, whose liberty and simple
manners at once astonish and delight us? When visiting
the isles of Greece, where the charm of memory
rendered the view of their actual slavery more revolting,
what delight the traveller experiences in traversing the
little isle of Casos which had never submitted to the
Ottoman yoke! He there found the usages of the
ancient Greeks, their costume, their beauty and their
amiable and elevated natural manner. This isle is but
a rock. But its dangerous shores have defended it
against tyranny. Associations with the songs of Homer
and Hesiod are renewed. Such a picture delights even
a people whose manners are refined to a degree tending
to depravation. Thus those opulent citizens who find
the country a place of exile still decorate their splendid
halls with landscapes and flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Let not a sensitive and wandering imagination kindle
too readily at the recitals of travellers. Were we to
transport ourselves to one of those remote points of the
earth where felicity is represented to have chosen her
asylum, new usages, manners and pleasures, and a foreign
people every moment reminding us that we are
strangers, would, perhaps, give birth to the most painful
regrets. When in our youth we were charmed as we
read of the prodigies of Athens and Rome, we uttered
the wish that we had been born in those renowned republics.
There is little doubt that, had our wish been
realized, we should be glad to escape their storms, in
exchange for obscurely tranquil days.</p>

<p>It is a distinguished folly which impels men far from
their country in search of happiness. The greater portion,
deceived in their hopes after having wandered
amidst danger, die with regret and sorrow, worn out
with vexation resulting from the broken ties and remembrances
of home. Home is the last thought that comes
over the departing mind. ‘Et dulces moriens reminiscitur
Argos.’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi patria ibi bene</i> is an adage which
contains as much wise observation as elevated patriotism.
Our country is our common mother. We ought
to love and sustain her more firmly in her misery than
in her prosperity.</p>

<p>Whatever manners, opinions and talents we carry into
another country, we are still strangers there. The manners
which we adopt are new and irksome. The eye
sees nothing to awaken dear and embellished remembrances;
and we find in the heart of no one the reverberating
chord of ancient friendship and sympathy. We
always regret the places where we knew the first pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and the first pains, and saw the first enchanting
visions of life; the cherished spots where we learned to
love and be loved. If, returning there, drawn back by
an invincible sentiment, after a long absence we see it
again, what sorrows await us! We find ourselves strangers
in our own country. We ask for our parents and
friends who departed in succession. The blows were
struck at long intervals. We receive them all in a moment.
We return to shed tears only on the tombs of
our fathers!<a name="NOTEanchor_15" id="NOTEanchor_15"></a><a href="#NOTE_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Retreat and competence everywhere supply a wise
man a degree of independence. Even when the sport
of oppression and injustice, he yields to these evils as
the caprices of destiny. He would be free in the midst
of Constantinople under the government of the Sultan.</p>

<p>Another kind of liberty is the portion of but a few in
our own country&mdash;the liberty of disposing of our whole
time at our choice. To those who understand not the
value of time, this liberty bequeaths a heavy bondage.
But to those who have learned the secret of happiness
it is of inestimable value. The privilege of the favored
possessor of opulence is a high one. Neither the slave
of business, fashion, opinion or routine, it is in his power
at awaking to say ‘this day is all my own.’<a name="NOTEanchor_15a" id="NOTEanchor_15a"></a><a href="#NOTE_15a" class="fnanchor">[15a]</a></p>

<p>But moralists exclaim, ‘you must pay your debt:
you must render yourselves useful to society.’ Let me
not be understood to inculcate the doctrine of indolence.
Industry will have wings and power when you unite it to
freedom. But how many repeat the hackneyed cry of
‘the debt to society,’ who, in the choice of their profession,
had never a thought but of its honors and emoluments!
This man whose industry in the pursuit of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
choice proves that his toil is his pleasure, that man who
is in earnest to serve every one whom he can oblige and
who might have shone, had he chosen it, in the career of
ambition, but who, modest, proud, studious and free, lives
happily in the bosom of retreat, has this man done nothing
to acquit his debt? Is his example useless to society?</p>

<p>If my condition deny me leisure and independence in
regard to the disposal of my time, without bestowing
much concern upon the choice of my profession, I
should choose that most favorable to free thoughts, to
breathing the open air, and, as much as might be, in
view of a beautiful nature. I should consider it as a
most important element in my happiness that I should be
chiefly conversant with people of compatible characters.
The profession of an advocate, perpetually conversant
with the follies, vices and crimes of society, is one of the
most trying, both to integrity and philosophy. That of
the physician, continually witnessing groans, tears and
physical suffering, however painful to sensibility, may
become the source of high reflected pleasure to a generous
and humane heart. I would avoid a function the
disquieting responsibility of which would disturb my
sleep. Above all, I should dread one of high honor and
emolument, connected with proportionate uncertainty of
tenure.</p>

<p>The balance of enjoyment being taken into view, I
should prefer an occupation of privacy. It would be
more easy at once to obtain and preserve. It would
expose me less to envy and competition. Exempt
from the inquietudes inspired by severe labors, and the
ennui of important etiquette, I should at least find an absolute
independence, every evening, at the relinquishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of my daily routine of occupation, and I should
suffer no care for the morrow; I would learn to enhance
the charms of my condition by thinking of the agitation,
regrets and alarms of those who are still swept by the
whirlwinds of life. In this way I would imitate him who,
to procure a more delicious repose, placed his couch
under a tent near the sea, to be lulled by the dashing of
its waves and the noise of its storms. But it is time to
contemplate the most useful kind of liberty, the only indispensable
kind, and happily one which is accessible to
all. It is the liberty resulting from self-command and
inward mastery of ourselves. It has a value to cause
all others to be forgotten&mdash;a value which no other kind
can replace.</p>

<p>What liberty can that man enjoy who is the slave of
ambition? A gesture, a look of the eye, a smile affrightens
him and causes him painful and trembling calculations
what that sinister sign of his master may presage.</p>

<p>Look at the opulent merchant whose hopes are the
sport of the winds, seas, robbers, changes of trade, municipal
regulations, and a crowd of agents who seem
subordinate, but who really command him.</p>

<p>Whatever kind of liberty we aim to possess, we may
certainly conclude that the surest means to enjoy it is to
have few wants. But how restrain our wants? The
greater portion are happily placed by their condition
where they are ignorant of the objects which most powerfully
excite and seduce desire. The golden mean
secludes them from many temptations full of the bitterest
regret, and exacts of them little effort of wisdom.
In the class of men of leisure and elevated mind there
are two means of rising above many wants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The more austere philosophers have altogether disdained
those pleasures which they could never hope to
obtain. Reducing themselves to the limits of the strictest
necessity, they indemnify themselves for some privations
by the certainty of being secured from many pains,
and by the sentiment of conscious independence. This
is, doubtless, one of the surest means of obtaining independence;
and they who attempt to employ any other,
differ from the vulgar by their principles rather than
their conduct.</p>

<p>How many objects, of which the contemplation
awakens the desires, would have nothing dangerous if
we could always exercise a stern self-control over our
minds! The surest means of exercising this self-control
is to reduce the number of our wants. To do it, I
admit, demands a rare elevation of mind and the exercise
of a high degree of philosophy. But since its value
is beyond its cost, let us dare to acquire it.</p>

<p>While the fleeting dreams of pleasure hover around
us, let reason still say to us, ‘an instant may dissipate
them.’ Let us, then, be ready to find a new pleasure in
the consciousness of our firmness and our masculine and
vigorous independence. An enlightened mind reigns
over pleasures; and while they glitter around, enjoys
all that are innocent; but disdains a sigh or a regret
when they have taken wings and disappeared.</p>

<p>I commend the example of Alcibiades, the disciple of
the graces and of wisdom, who astonished in turn the proud
Persian by his dignity, and the Lacedemonian by his
austerity. His enemies may charge him with incessant
change of principle. To me he seems always the same,
always superior to the men and circumstances that surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
him. Such strong mental stamina resemble those
robust plants that sustain, without annoyance, the extremes
of heat and cold.</p>

<span class="fs70">OF HEALTH.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Health results from moderation, gayety and the absence
of care. Eternal wisdom has ordained, that the
emotions which disturb our days, are those which have
a natural tendency to shorten them.<a name="NOTEanchor_16" id="NOTEanchor_16"></a><a href="#NOTE_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>If there were ground for a single charge against the
justice of nature, it would be, that the errors of inexperience
seem punished with too great severity. We
prodigally waste the material of life and enjoyment, as
we do our other possessions, as if we thought it inexhaustible.</p>

<p>To the errors of youth succeed the vices of mature
age. Ambition and cupidity, envy and hatred concur to
devour the very aliment of life. The storms which
prostrate the moral faculties, equally sap the physical
energy. Every debasing passion is a consuming poison.
To what other source of evil can we assign those inquietudes
and puerile anxieties, which disturb the days of
the greater portion of mankind? They are occupied by
trifling interests, and agitated by vain debates. They
watch for futile excitements, and are in desolation from
chimerical troubles. Pleasant emotions sustain life, and
produce upon it the effect of a gentle current of air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
upon flame. Trains of thought habitually elevated, and
sometimes inclined to revery, impart pure and true gayety
to the soul. To be able to command this train is
one of the rarest felicities of endowment. A distinguished
physician recorded in his tablets the apparent
paradox, that three quarters of men die of vexation or
grief.</p>

<p>Huffland has published a work, upon the art of prolonging
life, full of interesting observations. ‘Philosophers,’
says he, ‘enjoy a delightful leisure. Their
thoughts, generally estranged from vulgar interests, have
nothing in common with those afflicting ideas, with which
other men are continually agitated and corroded. Their
reflections are agreeable by their variety, their vague
liberty, and sometimes even by their frivolity. Devoted
to the pursuits of their choice, the occupations of their
taste, they dispose freely of their time. Oftentimes they
surround themselves with young people, that their natural
vivacity may be communicated to them, and, in
some sort, produce a renewal of their youth.’ We may
make a distinction between the different kinds of philosophy,
in relation to their influence upon the duration of
life. Those which direct the mind towards sublime
contemplations, even were they in some degree superstitious,
such as those of Pythagoras and Plato, are the
most salutary. Next to them, I place those, the study
of which, embracing nature, gives enlarged and elevated
ideas upon infinity, the stars, the wonders of the universe,
the heroic virtues, and other similar subjects.
Such were those of Democritus, Philolaus, Xenophanes,
the Stoics, and the ancient astronomers.’</p>

<p>‘I may cite next those less profound thinkers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
instead of exacting difficult researches, seemed destined
only to amuse the mind; the followers of which
philosophy, deviating wide from vulgar opinion, peaceably
sustain the arguments for and against the propositions
advanced. Such was the philosophy of Carneades
and the Academicians, to whom we may add the
Grammarians and Rhetoricians.’</p>

<p>‘But those which turn only upon painful subtilties,
which are affirmative, dogmatic and positive, which bend
all facts and opinions to form and adjust them to certain
preconceived principles and invariable measures; in
fine, such as are thorny, arid, narrow and contentious,
these are fatal in tendency, and cannot but abridge
the life of those, who cultivate them. Of this class was
the philosophy of the Peripatetics, and that also of the
Scholastics.’</p>

<p>Tumultuous passions and corroding cares are two
sources of evil influences, which philosophy avoids.
Another influence, adverse to life, is that mental feebleness,
which renders persons perpetually solicitous about
their health, effeminate and unhappy. Fixing their
thoughts intensely on the functions of life, those functions,
that are subjects of this anxious inspection, labor.
Imagining themselves sick, they soon become so. The
undoubting confidence that we shall not be sick, is perhaps
the best prophylactic for preserving health.</p>

<p>I am ignorant of the exact influence of moral upon
physical action, in relation to health. But of this I am
confident, that it is prodigious; that physicians have not
made it a sufficient element in their calculations, or
employed it as they should; and that in future, under a
wise and more philosophic direction, it may operate an
immense result, both in restoring and preserving health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>A man reads a letter, which announces misfortunes,
or sinister events. His head turns. His appetite ceases.
He becomes faint, and oppressed; and his life is in danger.
No contagion, however, no physical blow has
touched him. A thought has palsied his forces in a
moment; and has successively deranged every spring
of life. We have read of persons of feeble and uninformed
mind, who have fallen sick, in consequence of
the cruel sport of those, who have ingeniously alarmed
their imagination, and cautiously indicated to them a
train of fatal symptoms. Since imagination can thus
certainly overturn our physical powers, why may it not,
under certain regulations, restore them? Among the
numberless recorded cases of cures, reputed miraculous,
it is probable, that a great part may be accounted for on
this principle.<a name="NOTEanchor_17" id="NOTEanchor_17"></a><a href="#NOTE_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Suppose a paralytic disciple of the school of miracles,
whose head is exalted with ideas of the mystic power of
certain holy men, and who is meditating on the succor
which he expects from a divine interposition manifested
in his favor. In an ecstasy of faith, he sees a minister
of heaven descend enveloped in light, who bids him
‘arise, and walk.’ In a moment the unknown nervous
energy, excited by the mysterious power of faith, touches
the countless inert and relaxed movements. The man
arises and walks. During the siege of Lyons, when
bombs fell on the hospital, the terrified paralytics arose
and fled.</p>

<p>I am not disposed to question all the cures, which in
France have been attributed to magnetism. We know,
what a salutary effect the sight of his physician produces
on the patient, who has confidence in him. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cheerful and encouraging conversations are among the
most efficient remedies. If we entertained a long cherished
and intimate persuasion, that by certain signs, or
touches, he could dispel our complaints, his gestures
would have a high moral and physical influence. Magnetism
was in this sense, as Bailly justly remarked, a
true experiment upon the power of the imagination. At
the moment of its greatest sway, while some regarded it
an infallible specific, and others deemed it entirely inefficient,
another class held it in just estimation. I cite
an extract from the report of the Academy of Science.</p>

<p>‘We have sought,’ say they, ‘to recognise the presence
of the magnetic fluid. But it escaped our senses.
It was said, that its action upon animated bodies was the
sole proof of its existence. The experiments, which we
made upon ourselves, convinced us, that, as soon as we
diverted our attention, it was powerless. Trials made upon
the sick taught us, that infancy, which is unsusceptible
of prejudice experienced nothing from it; that mental
alienation resisted the action of magnetism, even in an
habitual condition of excitability of the nerves, where
the action ought to have been most sensible. The
effects which are attributed to this fluid, are not visible,
except when the imagination is forewarned, and capable
of being struck. Imagination, then, seems to be the
principle of the action.</p>

<p>‘It remained to be seen, whether we could reproduce
these effects by the influence of imagination alone. We attempted
it, and fully succeeded. Without touching the
subjects, who believed themselves magnetised, and without
employing any sign, they complained of pain and a
great sensation of heat. On subjects, endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
more excitable nerves, we produced convulsions, and
what they called <em>crises</em>. We have seen an exalted imagination
become sufficiently energetic to take away the
power of speech in a moment. At the same time, we
proved the nullity of magnetism, put in opposition with
the imagination. Magnetism alone, employed for thirty
minutes, produced no effect. Imagination put in action
produced upon the same person, with the same means,
in circumstances absolutely similar, a strong, and well
defined convulsion.</p>

<p>‘In fine, to complete the demonstration, and to finish
the painting of the effect of the imagination, a power
equally capable of agitating, and calming, we have caused
those convulsions to cease by the same power, which
produced them&mdash;the power of the imagination.</p>

<p>‘What we have learned, or, at least what has been
confirmed to us in a demonstrative and evident manner,
by examination of the processes of magnetism is, that
man can act upon man at every moment and almost at
will, by striking his imagination; that signs and gestures
the most simple may have effects the most powerful;
and that the influence which may be exerted upon
the imagination, may be reduced to an art, and conducted
by method.’</p>

<p>These truths had never before acquired so much evidence.
We know, that cures may be wrought by the
single influence of imagination. Ambrose Paré Boerhaave,
and many other physicians, have cited striking
proofs of this fact. The first of these writers procured
abundant sweats for a patient, in making him believe
that a perfectly inert substance given him, was a violent
sudorific.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worthy of the attention of moralists and physiologists,
as well as physicians, to examine, to what point we
may obtain salutary effects, by exciting the imagination.
But perhaps, there would soon be cause to dread the
perilous influence of this art, which can kill, as well as
make alive. This excitable and vivid faculty is never
more easily put in operation, that when acted upon by
the presentiments of charlatanism and superstition.</p>

<p>We possess another means of operation, which may be
exercised without danger, and the power of which is,
also, capable of producing prodigies. Education rendering
most men feeble and timid, they are ignorant,
how much an energetic will can accomplish. It is able
to shield us from many maladies; and to hasten the
cure of those under which we labor.</p>

<p>In mortal epidemics, the physicians, who are alarmed
at their danger, are ordinarily the first victims. Fear
plunges the system into that state of debility, which
predisposes it to fatal impressions, while the moral force
of confidence, communicating its aid to physical energy,
enables it to repel contagion.</p>

<p>I could cite many distinguished names of men, who
attributed their cure, in desperate maladies, to the courage
which never forsook them, and to the efforts which
they made to keep alive the vital spark, when ready to
become extinct. One of them pleasantly said, ‘I
should have died like the rest, had I wished it.’<a name="NOTEanchor_18" id="NOTEanchor_18"></a><a href="#NOTE_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Pecklin, Barthes and others think that extreme desire
to see a beloved person once more, has sometimes
a power to retard death. It is a delightful idea. I feel
with what intense ardor one might desire to live another
day, another hour, to see a friend or a child for the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
time. The flame of love, replacing that of life, blazes
up for a moment before both are quenched in the final
darkness. The last prayer is accorded; and life terminates
in tasting that pleasure for which it was prolonged.
If this be true, the principle on which the most
touching incident of romance is founded, is not a fiction.</p>

<p>I have no need to say that an energetic will to recover
from sickness has no point of analogy with that fearful
solicitude which the greater part of the sick experience.
The latter, produced by mental feebleness, increases the
inquietude and aggravates the danger. Even indifference
would be preferable. If education had imparted
to us the advantages of an energetic will and real force
of mind, if from infancy we had been convinced of the
efficacy of this moral power, we have no means to determine
that it would not have been, in union with the desire
of life, an element in the means of healing our maladies.</p>

<p>Medicine is still a science so conjectural that the most
salutary method of cure, in my view, is that which strives
not to contradict nature, but to second her efforts by
moral means. I am ready to believe that amidst the
real or imagined triumphs of science, those of medicine
will, in the centuries to come, hold a rank to which
its past achievements will have borne no proportion.
But what an immense amount of experiment will be necessary!
How many unfortunate beings must contribute
to the expense of these experiments!</p>

<p>Contrary to the general opinion, I highly esteem physicians
and think but very little of medicine. In the
profession of medicine we find the greatest number of
men of solid minds and various erudition; and the best
friends of humanity. But they are in the habit of vaunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the progress of their science. To me it seems incessantly
changing its principles, without ever varying
its results. The systems of various great men have been
successively received and rejected. Do we, however,
imagine that the great physicians who have preceded us
were more unfortunate in their practice than those of
our days? Among the most eminent physicians of our
cities, one practises by administering strong cathartics.
Another is resolute for copious bleeding. A third bids
us watch and wait the indications of nature. Each of
these assumes that the system of the rest is fatal&mdash;and
so, it would seem, it should be. At the end of the year,
however, I doubt if any one of them all has more reproaches
to make, as regards want of success, than any
other.</p>

<p>From these facts, there are those who hold that it is
most prudent to confide to nature, as the physician; forgetful
that, if he could bring no other remedy than hope,
he unites moral to physical aid. Yet, the very persons
who, in health are readiest to maintain this doctrine, like
children who are heroes during the day but cowards in
the dark, when they are sick, are as prompt as others in
sending for the physician.</p>

<p>Even if agitation and fear had not fatal effects, in rendering
us more accessible to maladies, wisdom would
strive to banish them, in pursuit of the science of happiness.
Fear, by anticipating agony, doubles our sufferings.
If there could exist a rational ground for continual
inquietude, it would be found in a frail constitution. But
how many men of the feeblest health survive those of
the most vigorous and robust frame! Calculations upon
the duration of life are so uncertain that we can always
make them in our favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>To him who cultivates a mild and pleasant philosophy,
old age itself should not be contemplated with
alarm. It may seem a paradox to say that all men are
nearly of the same age, in reference to their chances of
another day. Men are as confident of seeing tomorrow
and the succeeding day, at eighty, as at sixteen. Such
is the beautiful veil with which nature conceals from us
the darkness of the future.</p>

<p>In general, men have less sympathy for the suffering
than their condition ought to inspire. We meet them
with a sad face and are more earnest to show them that
we are afflicted ourselves, than to seek to cheer their
dejection. We multiply so many questions touching
their health that it would seem as if we feared to allow
them to forget that they were sick.</p>

<p>Of all subjects of conversation, my own pains and physical
infirmities have become the least interesting to me;
as I know they must be to others. I do not wish that
those who surround my sick bed should converse as
though arranging the preparations for my last dress, or
determining the hour of my interment.</p>

<p>If we would live in peace, and die in tranquillity, let
us, as much as possible, avoid importunate cares. Our
business is to unite as many friends as we may; and to beguile
pain and sorrow by treasuring as many resources
of innocent amusement as our means will admit. If our
sufferings become painful and incurable, we must concentrate
our mental energy and settle on our solitary
powers of endurance. We die, or we recover. Nature,
though calm, moves irresistibly to her point; and complaint
is always worse than useless.<a name="NOTEanchor_19" id="NOTEanchor_19"></a><a href="#NOTE_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>But in arming ourselves with courage to support our
own evils, let us preserve sensibility and sympathy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the sufferings of others. It is among the dangerously
sick that we find those unfortunate beings who are most
worthy to inspire our pity. Their only expectation is
death, preceded by cruel tortures; and yet they, probably,
suffer less for themselves than for weeping dependents
whom they are leaving, it may be, without a single
prop. Ah! during the few days of sorrow that remain
to them on the earth, how earnestly ought we to strive
to mitigate their pains, to calm their alarms and animate
their feeble hopes! Blessed be that beneficent being
who shall call one smile more upon their dying lips!<a name="NOTEanchor_20" id="NOTEanchor_20"></a><a href="#NOTE_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<span class="fs70">OF COMPETENCE.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Pretended sages announce to us, with sententious
gravity, that virtue ought to be the single object of our
desires; that, strengthened by it, we can support privations
and misery without suffering. Useless moralists!
Shall I yield faith to precepts which the experience of
every day falsifies? It is only necessary, in refutation,
to present a man who has broken his limb, or whose
children suffer hunger.</p>

<p>His plan is wise, who examines, with a judgment free
from ambition, the amount of fortune necessary to competence
in his case, viewed in all its bearings; and commences
the steady pursuit of it. Having reached that
measure, if his desires impel him beyond the limit which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in a more reasonable hour, he prescribed for himself, he
henceforward strives to be happy by sacrificing enjoyment.
He barters it for a very uncertain means of purchasing
even pleasures. In this way competence becomes
useless to the greater part of those who obtain it.
Victims of the common folly, and still wishing a little
more, they lose, in the effort to get rich, the time which
they ought to spend in enjoyment. We see grasping
and adroit speculators on every side; and, but rarely,
men who know how to employ the resources of a moderate
fortune. It is not the art of acquiring beyond competence,
but of wisely spending, that we need to learn.</p>

<p>Our business in life is to be happy; and yet, simple
and obvious as this truism is, the greater number disdain
or forget it. To judge from the passions and objects
that we see exciting man to action, we should suppose
that he was placed on the earth, not to become
happy, but rich.</p>

<p>To what purpose so many cares and studies? ‘That
man,’ we are answered with a peculiar emphasis, ‘has
an immense income.’ In his rare, brilliant and envied
condition, if he does not vegetate under the weight of
ennui, I recognise in him a man of astonishing merit.</p>

<p>The opulent may be divided into two classes. The
employment of the one is to watch over their expenditures.
The other study the mode of dissipating their
revenue. Can I present, in detail, the cares and vexations
which an immense fortune brings? The possessor
leaves discussion with his tenants, to commence angry
disputes with his workmen. From these he departs to
listen to the schemes of projectors, or to the information of
advocates. Is not such a result dearly purchased at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
expense of repose, independence and time? Would it
not be better to relinquish a part of these possessions, in
order to dispose, in peace, of the remainder? I admit
that a man who devotes himself to lucrative pursuits is
not overwhelmed with continual ennui. The banker
respires again, after having grown pale over his accounts.
A speculation has succeeded, and the enchantment of
success banishes his alarms, fatigues and slavery. But
he whose purpose in life is to secure as many happy
moments as he can, and who sees how many innocent
pleasures the other allows to escape him, would refuse
his fortune at the price which he pays for it.</p>

<p>Another opulent class inherit fortunes acquired by the
industry and sacrifices of their fathers. Rendered effeminate
in a school, the reverse of that in which their
fathers were trained, without resources in themselves,
accustomed from infancy to have their least desires anticipated,
under the influence of feeble parents, pliant
and servile instructers, greedy servants and a seducing
world, their appetite is early palled, and every pleasure
in life worn out.</p>

<p>But suppose the rich heir brought up as though he
were not rich, destiny places before him a strange alternative.
If he succeed in resisting desires which everything
excites and favors, what painful struggles! If he
yield to them, what effort can preserve him an untainted
mind? The experience of all time declares the improbability
that he will resist. So many pretended
friends are at hand to take up the cause of the present
against the future, a cause, too, which always finds a
powerful patron in our own bosoms! The pleasures of
the senses have, besides, this dangerous advantage, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
before we have tasted them we are sufficiently instructed
by the imagination, that we shall receive vivid and
delightful emotions from their indulgence. We are not
certain that pleasures of a higher class have a charm of
enchantment until after we have made the happy experiment.
Thus everything prepares the opulent for
the sadness of satiety, moral disgust and ennui without
end, the only suffering of life which is not softened by
hope.</p>

<p>You will sometimes see these men at public places
where they are professedly in search of amusement,
giving no sign of existence except by an occasional yawn.
Cast your eyes on those spectators who are alive to
the most vivid enthusiasm. They are young students
or mechanics who have economised ten days to spend
an hour of the eleventh in this amusement!<a name="NOTEanchor_21" id="NOTEanchor_21"></a><a href="#NOTE_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is in
clean cottages, in small but well directed establishments,
that pleasures are vivid, because they are obtained at a
price, and through industry and order. A festival is
projected, or a holiday returns. Friends are assembled,
and how blithe and free is the joy! A slight economy
has been practised to supply the moderate expenses.
There is high pleasure in looking forward to the epoch
and in making the arrangements in anticipation. There
is still more pleasure in the remembrance. When the
interval which separates us from pleasure is not very
long, even this interval has charms.</p>

<p>What a touching narrative is recorded of the suppers
of two of the greatest men of the past age, of whom one
was the Abbe de Condillac. Both were so poor that
the expenses were reduced to absolute necessaries. But
what conversations prolonged the repast, and with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
swiftness flew the enchanted hours! Neither great
genius nor profound acquirements are necessary to enjoy
evenings equally pleasant.</p>

<p>In an establishment of moderate competence, those
who compose it rarely leave it. All the joys which
spring up in the bosom of a beloved family seem to
have been created for them. Give them riches, without
changing their hearts, and they would taste less pleasure.
New duties and amusements would trench upon a part
of that time which had hitherto been sacred to friendship.
More conversant with society, they would be less together.
Receiving more visitants, they would see fewer
friends. Transported into a new sphere where a thousand
objects of comparison would excite their desires,
they would, perhaps, for the first time, experience privations
and regrets.</p>

<p>Women and young people taste the advantages which
a retired, pleasant and modest condition offers only so
long as they avoid comparisons of that lot with one which
the world considers more favored. <em>We must carry into
the world a high philosophy, or never quit our retreat.</em></p>

<p>Persons even of a disciplined reason, just thought and
a noble character, may grow dizzy, for a moment, with
the splendor and noise of opulence, perceived for the
first time. But as soon as they begin to blush and forfeit
self-respect in tracing the causes of their intoxication,
the scene vanishes, and, as they contemplate and compare,
it is replaced by the sentiment of their own happiness.
In the midst of the brilliant crowd they experience
a legitimate pride in saying, ‘from how many regrets
and cares am I saved! How many futilities are here,
of which I have no need!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>But I shall be told that opulence has at least this advantage,
that it attracts consideration. There is no doubt
that many people measure the esteem they pay you by
the scale of your riches. You will never persuade them
that merit often walks on foot, while stupidity rides in a
carriage.</p>

<p>But will a man esteem himself a philosopher, and
take into his calculation the opinion of such fools as these?
In a circle where opulence puts forth its splendor, when
you experience a slight revulsion of shame in perceiving
that the simplicity of your dress is remarked, ask
yourself if you would change your mode of life, character
and talents with those around you? If you feel
that you would not, repress the weakness of wishing
incompatible advantages; and resume the self-respect
of an honest man.<a name="NOTEanchor_21a" id="NOTEanchor_21a"></a><a href="#NOTE_21a" class="fnanchor">[21a]</a></p>

<p>To be satisfied with a moderate fortune is, perhaps,
the highest test and best proof of philosophy. All others
seem to me doubtful. He who can live content on a
little, gives a pledge that he would preserve his probity
and courage in the most difficult situations. He has
placed his virtue, repose and happiness as far as possible
above the caprices of his kind, and the vicissitudes of
earthly things.</p>

<p>There are moments when the desire of wealth penetrates
even the retreat of a sage, not with the puerile and
dangerous wish to dazzle with show, but with the hope,
dear to a good mind, that it might become a means of
extended usefulness. When imagination creates her gay
visions, we sometimes think of riches, and in our dreams
make an employment of them worthy of envy. What
a delightful field then opens before those who possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
riches? They can encourage the progress of science,
and aid in advancing the glory of letters. How much
assistance they can offer to deserving young people
whose first efforts announce happy dispositions, and
whose character, at the same time, little fitted for
worldly success, is a compound of independence and
timidity? How much they may honor themselves in
decking the modest retreat of the aged scholar who has
consecrated his life to study, and who has neglected his
personal fortune to enrich the age with inventions of
genius! They have the means of giving a noble impulse
to the arts, without trenching upon their resources.
A picture, which perpetuates the remembrance of a
generous or heroic exploit, costs no more than a group
of bacchanalians or debauchees. A career more beautiful
still, is open to opulence. Of how many vices and
how many tears it may dry the source! A rich man,
to become happy, has only to wish to become so. He
can not only immortalize his name as the patron of arts
and useful inventions, but, what is better, can deserve
the blessings of the miserable. Such pleasures are
durable, and may be tasted, with unsated relish, after a
settled lassitude from the indulgence of all others.<a name="NOTEanchor_22" id="NOTEanchor_22"></a><a href="#NOTE_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Let not such seducing dreams, however, leave us a
prey to ambitious and disappointing desires at our
awakening. It is in the sphere where Providence has
placed us, that we must search for the means of being
useful; and if there are pleasures which belong only to
opulence, there are others which can best be found in
mediocrity. Perhaps, in giving us riches, we shall
realize but half the dream of virtue and contentment.
‘It seems to me,’ says Plato, ‘that gold and virtue were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
placed in the opposite scales of a balance; and that we
cannot throw an additional weight into one scale, without
subtracting an equal amount from the other.’</p>

<span class="fs70">OF OPINION AND THE AFFECTION OF MEN.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>In selecting the same route, in which the agitated
crowd is pressing onward, we are evidently on the wrong
road to happiness; since we hear the multitude on every
side expressing dissatisfaction with their life. If we
choose a different path, we cannot expect to evade the
shafts of censure, since the same multitude are naturally
disposed, from pride of opinion, to think all, not on the
same road with themselves, astray. It is, then, an egregious
folly to hope for a happiness thus pursued by system,
and for the approbation of the vulgar at the same time.
Among the obstacles which are at war with our repose,
one of the greatest, and at the same time most frivolous,
is the fatal necessity of becoming of importance to others,
instead of becoming calmly sufficient to ourselves.
Like restless children, always seduced by appearances,
it is a small point, that we are happy in our condition.
We desire that it should excite envy. A happiness
which glares not in the eyes of the multitude, compelling
them to take note of it, is no longer regarded as happiness.
There are both dupes and victims of opinion.
Those who are devoured by the fever of intrigue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
those who, to dazzle others, dissipate their fortune, are the
miserable victims. The dupes are those who voluntarily
weary themselves out of three quarters of their life,
and offer this as their apology&mdash;‘these visits, these ceremonies,
these evening parties! they are tiresome, we
grant. But we must mix with good company.’ Why
not always mix with the best&mdash;your own enlightened
and free thoughts?</p>

<p>I shall be obliged to present one truth under a thousand
forms. It is that much courage is exacted for the
attainment of happiness. Such a man has estimable
qualities, an interesting family, tried friends, a fortune
equal to his wants. His lot ought to seem a delightful
one. How differently the public judge! ‘This man,’
says the public, ‘has intelligence. Why has he not increased
his fortune? He is able to distinguish himself.
Why has he not sought place or office? He seems to
stand aloof, that he may pique himself on a proud and
foolish originality. We judge him less favorably. Every
one distinguishes himself, that can. To be without distinction
is a proof that he has not power to acquire it.’ If
the man, of whom this is said, has not courage, mourn
over him. The public will end, by rendering him
ashamed of his happiness.</p>

<p>To hear the false reasoning of the multitude is not
what astonishes me. That stupid people, full of self-esteem,
should hold these foolish discourses, with strong
emphasis, is perfectly natural. What I wonder at is, that
their maxims should guide people of understanding.</p>

<p>We are guilty of the whimsical contradiction of
judging our own ideas with complacency, and of pronouncing
upon those of others with severity. Yet we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
every day sacrifice principles which we esteem, through
fear of being blamed by people whom we despise.<a name="NOTEanchor_23" id="NOTEanchor_23"></a><a href="#NOTE_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The moment I escape the yoke of opinion, what a
vast and serene horizon stretches out before my eyes!
The pleasures of vanity scatter, like morning mists.
Those of repose and independence remain. I no longer
sacrifice to the disquieting desire of preserving a protector,
or eclipsing my rivals. I am no longer the slave
of gloomy etiquette. I henceforward prolong my delightful
evenings for my own enjoyment. The caprices
of men have lost their empire over me. If poor, I shall
remain a stranger to the pains excited by blasting ridicule
and overwhelming contempt. If rich, indolent and
impertinent people will no longer regulate my expenses;
and the happy choice of my pleasures will multiply my
riches. These are presented to a wise man in two opposite
relations. Do they call for a service? The most tender
interest excites him to their aid. Do they show a disposition
to manage him? He meets the attempt only
with profound disdain. He who possesses a disciplined
reason, and a courageous mind, does not choose to walk
by the faith of a feeble and uncertain guide, who has
need himself to be led. Allow yourself to become docile
to the eccentric laws of opinion, and the slave of its
imperious caprices, and follow it with the most earnest
perseverance of loyalty; still it will finally terminate in
condemning you.</p>

<p>But hypocrisy opens against me, and feeble men ask
me, if it be not dangerous, thus to inculcate contempt of
opinion? In following but a part of the ideas, which I
announce, my readers might be led astray. The whole
must be adopted, for a fair experiment of the result. A
physician had chosen many plants, from which to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a salutary decoction. His patient swallowed the juice
of but one and was poisoned.</p>

<p>Let us discard that timidity, which conducts to falsehood;
and, to subserve morals, let us be faithful to truth.
The wicked and the sage alike break the yoke of opinion;
the former to increase his power of annoyance; the
latter that of doing good.</p>

<p>I can conceive, that a depraved man will commit
fewer faults, in yielding to the caprices of opinion, than
in abandoning himself to his own errors. There are
cruel passions and shameful vices, which he reproves
even in the midst of his aberrations. But in doing so
he gives to falsehood the name of politeness, and to
cowardice the title of prudence. His favorite inculcation
is, <em>the terror of ridicule</em>. To form true men, it
is indispensable, that this precept should be engraven on
their hearts&mdash;<em>Fear nothing but remorse</em>.</p>

<p>The simple and generous mind, that follows these lessons,
and is worthy of happiness, need not blush, in
view of his course. Only let him march on with unshrinking
courage. In breaking the yoke of opinion, let
him fly the still more shameful chains which the passions
impose. In contemning the prejudices of the multitude
dread still more those fatal instructers, who treat morality
as a popular fable, and pretend to the honor of dispelling
our errors. The aberrations of opinion prove
only, that the most bold, not the most virtuous, press forward
to announce their principles. These principles
cannot annihilate that secret and universal opinion, that
voice of conscience, without which the moral world
would have presented only a chaos; and the human
race would have perished. Consult those men, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
have been instructed by the lessons of wisdom and experience.
Consult those whom you would choose to resemble.
Their first precept will be, that you descend
into yourself. If we interrogate conscience, in
good faith, she will enlighten us. She makes herself
heard in the tumult of our vices, even against our will.
If she become distorted, during the storm of our passions,
she recovers the serenity of truth, as soon as that passes
away; as a river, which has been agitated by a tempest,
as soon as calm returns, reflects anew the verdure of the
shores and the azure of heaven.</p>

<p>If there were a people formed by sage laws, whose
words were frank, and whose actions upright, there it
would be a duty to hearken to the voice of opinion in
religious silence; and to follow its decrees, as though
they were those of the divinity. Phocion asked, what
foolish thing he had done when the Athenians applauded
him? Happy the country, where this would have
been a criminal pleasantry, and where the pages of that
chapter which condemns opinion ought to be torn out.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may be accused of contradiction, in saying
that, in the enlightened pursuit of happiness, the opinion
of the multitude must be received with neglect; and
yet, that it is pleasant to be esteemed by the society, of
which we are members. We receive their services, and
ought to know the pleasure of obliging them. We often
share those weaknesses, which we censure in them.
Our multiplied relations with them render their affection
desirable. It may not be necessary to happiness; but it
gives to enjoyment a more vivid charm.</p>

<p>May we be able, in pursuing the path indicated by
wisdom, to obtain esteem, and taste the delight of a sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
still pleasanter, and more precious. Friendship
is, to esteem, what the flower is to the stem which sustains
it.</p>

<p>But I can never imagine, that we ought to become
subservient to the caprices of opinion. We should first
be satisfied with ourselves; and afterwards, if it may be,
with others. To merit affection, I perceive but two
methods; to love our kind, and to cultivate those virtues
which diffuse a charm over life.</p>

<span class="fs70">OF THE SENTIMENT MEN OUGHT TO INSPIRE.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>There is no such being as a misanthrope. The men
designated by this name, may be divided into many
classes. In one class I see men of philosophic
minds, revolted by our vices, or shocked by our contradictions,
who censure these universal traits with a blunt
frankness. Their disgust springs from the evils, which
the universal follies of the age have shed upon our career.
But if they really hated men, would they wield
the pen of satire, in striving to correct them?</p>

<p>Another class consists of those unfortunate beings, who
hope to find peace only in solitude. They fly a world
which has pierced their heart with cruel wounds; and
perhaps avow, in words, an implacable hatred towards
men. But their sensibility belies their avowal; and we
soothe their griefs, as soon as we ask their services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, there are those who strive only to render themselves
singular, who are really less afflicted, than
whimsical; rather officious than observing. These would
tire us with the avowal of their love of mankind, if they
did not deem that they render themselves more piquant
and original by declaring that they hate them.</p>

<p>We may excuse indignation towards prejudices, contradictions
and vices. But how can man have merited hatred
or contempt? Man is good. Such is his primitive
character, which he can never entirely efface. Good,
but seduced, erring and unhappy, he has claims upon
our most tender interest.</p>

<p>I do not propose to vex the question whether man is
born good? I consider him to be born without either
virtue or vice. But as he advances in life, nature arranges
everything around him in such a manner, as
ought to render him good. A mother is the first object
that offers to his view. The first words which he hears
express the tenderest affection. Caresses inspire his
first sentiments; and his first occupations are sports.</p>

<p>Too soon, it is true, very different objects surround
him. As he grows into life, he is struck with such a
general spectacle of injustice, as reverses his ideas, and
sours his character. But, although the contagion reaches
him, and the passions and prejudices degrade him, some
traits of his primitive goodness will always remain in his
heart.</p>

<p>Even those terrible enthusiasts, who thrust themselves
forward in the effervescence of party, who, to give triumph
to their cause, blow up the incipient flame of civil discord,
and with an unshrinking hand raise the sword of
proscription, these fanatics may be strangers to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
humane sentiment. Yet many of them are seen to love
their wives and children with tenderness, and to preserve
in the bosom of their family, so to speak, the germs of
innocence. Robbers, the horror of society, whom the
gibbet claims, honor themselves with some acts of humanity;
and tyrants have their days of clemency.</p>

<p>During great calamities, natural sentiments develope
themselves, and form a touching contrast with the scenes
of horror with which they are surrounded. When a
destructive conflagration is sweeping along a city, there
are no distinctions, no animosities among the wretched
sufferers, whom the same terror pursues. Enemies forget
their hatred, and partisans their parties. The rich
and poor cry out together. All love and aid each
other. Misfortune has broken down the separating barriers
of pride and prejudice, and they find each other
good and equal.</p>

<p>Even upon the theatre of war, where the spectacle of
destruction excites an appetite to destroy, we often discover
affecting traces of humanity. At the siege of
Mentz, in 1795, I remember that the advanced guards
of the attack on the left, occupied an English garden,
near the village of Montback. The garden was completely
destroyed. The walks and labyrinths were
changed, by the trampling of the soldiers, into high
roads. Batteries were raised upon the mounds, from distance
to distance, around which still grew rare trees and
shrubs. The French bivouacs banished the verdure of
the bowling greens; and in advance of them, a half overturned
kiosk served for the front guard of the Austrians.
The nearest water was on their side; the nearest wood
on the side of the French. To obtain water, the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
threw their canteens to the Austrians, who filled them
and sent them back again. When night drew on, the
French soldiers, in return, cut wood for the Austrians,
and dragged fagots between the videttes of the two armies.
Thus, waiting the signal to cut each other’s throat,
the advance guards lived in peace, and made exchanges
like those between friendly people. This spectacle excited
in me a profound emotion; and I was scarcely able
to refrain from tears, in seeing men, so situated, still
good, on a soil red with blood.<a name="NOTEanchor_24" id="NOTEanchor_24"></a><a href="#NOTE_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>This primitive goodness is not the only beautiful trait
which is continually developing to our view in human nature.
For men to be generous, and magnanimous, the
soul never entirely loses the elevation, which it received
from its author.</p>

<p>Under oppression, in degradation, in slavery, men
still preserve some impress of their first dignity. Those
outrages which inflict personal humiliation, are among
the most frequent causes of revolutions; and, perhaps
tyrants incur less danger in shedding the blood of citizens,
than in insulting them. An outrage upon a woman was
the signal of the liberty of Rome. A similar crime
drew on the fall of the Pisistrati, who had found no obstacle
in overturning the laws of their country. The
Swiss and Danes supported the rigors of a tyrannic yoke
in silence. They arose the first day in which their oppressors
exacted of them an act of degradation. Genoa
had been conquered. An Austrian officer struck a man
of the lower class. The indignant Genoese flew to arms,
and drove away their conquerors.</p>

<p>Under the most absolute despotism, we sometimes
see the subjects preserving magnanimous sentiments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and not being able to give them a useful direction, put
forth, to serve their master, a courage equal to that with
which free citizens honor themselves in serving their
country. Of this I might cite striking proofs from the
history of even barbarous nations.</p>

<p>A convincing demonstration, that an innate principle
of elevation exists in the soul, results from the universality
of religious ideas. Man is discouraged by his errors,
his infirmities and faults in vain. An interior voice admonishes
him of his high destination. Transient as he
is, and comparatively lost in the immensity of the universe,
he invokes the Divinity to sanctify the union of his
espousals, and to preside over the birth of his infants.
He raises his voice to him over the tombs of his fathers.
When the contemplation of the works of the Eternal has
inspired him with humble sentiments of himself, he
still deems himself superior to all the beings that surround
him. Occupying but a point on the globe, his disquieting
thoughts embrace the universe. He beholds time
devouring the objects of his affections, crumbling monuments
and overturning even the works of nature. From
the midst of the ruins he aspires to immortality.<a name="NOTEanchor_24a" id="NOTEanchor_24a"></a><a href="#NOTE_24a" class="fnanchor">[24a]</a></p>

<p>What would not these sentiments, at once elevated
and good, these precious germs produce, were they developed
by happy circumstances! That they exist in
the human bosom is a sufficient indication that we owe
a tender interest to the being who possesses them. Let
us love our kind, and cultivate the virtues which render
us worthy of their affection.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XIII" id="LETTER_XIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LETTER XIII.</a><br /><br />

<span class="fs70">OF SOME OF THE VIRTUES.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Placed in the midst of men, the most useful virtue is
indulgence. To allow ourselves to become severe, is
to forget how many good qualities we want ourselves;
and from what faults we are preserved only by chance
and our circumstances. It is to forget the weakness of
men, and the empire exercised over them by the objects
that surround them. To render exact justice to our
kind, we ought to take into the estimate all the assistance
and all the obstacles, with which they have met in their
career. Thus weighing them, celebrated actions will
become less astonishing, and faults begin to appear excusable.</p>

<p>By cultivating the spirit of indulgence, we learn the
happy secret of being well with ourselves, and well with
men. Some carry into their intercourse with the world
an austere frankness. They are dreaded, and the opposition
which they every day experience, increases their
disagreeable and tiresome roughness, and their officious
rudeness. Others, blushing at no complaisance, and
equally supple and false, smile at what displeases them;
praise what they feel to be ridiculous; and applaud what
they know to be vile. Be indulgent, and you will not
sacrifice self-esteem; and your frankness, far from annoying,
will render your affability more amiable.</p>

<p>The less we occupy ourselves with the vices and aberrations
of men, the more pleasant does existence become.
Indulgence carries its own recompense with it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and causes us to see our kind almost such as they
should be.</p>

<p>Let us extend a courageous indulgence towards those
unfortunate beings, who are victims of long continued
errors. Enough will be ready to assume the office of
their accusers. Let us draw round them the veil of
charity. I am aware that gloomy moralists will object
to these views; and call them easy principles, that encourage
the vices, flatter the passions, and excuse disorders.
Believe me, the most easy and successful
mode of reclaiming the wandering, is to carry encouragement
and hope to their hearts, and to have faith in
their repentance.<a name="NOTEanchor_25" id="NOTEanchor_25"></a><a href="#NOTE_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Born in an age when every one professes to applaud
toleration, far from adopting the real spirit, we scarcely
know how to practise indulgence even towards abstract
opinions, that differ from our own. Let us never forget
the weakness and error of our own judgment and understanding;
and then we shall possess an habitual temper
of candor towards the views of others. In most instances,
when we say ‘that man thinks rightly,’ the phrase, when
translated, imports, ‘that man thinks as I do.’</p>

<p>Let us never forget that chance may have given us
the opinions most dear to us. The ardent patron of this
party, had he only been in a house contiguous to his
own, would have had opinions and prejudices, the exact
reverse of those he now reveres. It is not improbable
that he might have died in the opposite ranks.</p>

<p>A particular idea, which you formerly deemed correct,
at present seems false. Perhaps you may one day
return to your first judgment. Let us accord, to our antagonist,
a right which we frequently exercise for ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the right to be deceived. During the contests
of party, I have more than once seen the spectacle of
two men changing their principles almost at the same
moment, in such a manner, that one of them takes the
place of the other in the faction, which, but a short time
since, he professed to detest. Taking human nature as
it is, into view, this does not astonish me. What I find
strange is, that these two men should hate each other
more than ever, and that it has become impossible to
reconcile them, now that the one has espoused the opinion
which the other held but a moment before.<a name="NOTEanchor_26" id="NOTEanchor_26"></a><a href="#NOTE_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>An essential truth that ought to be constantly announced,
is, that both political and religious opinions have
much less influence than is commonly imagined upon
the qualities of the heart. No verity has been so completely
demonstrated to my conviction. I have been
conversant with men of all parties. In every one I have
met with persons full of disinterestedness and integrity.
To esteem them, it was only necessary to remark the
noble and unshrinking courage with which they were
willing to suspend everything on the issue of their convictions.<a name="NOTEanchor_27" id="NOTEanchor_27"></a><a href="#NOTE_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>A crowd of useful reflections upon this subject naturally
offer, upon which it would be easy to enlarge.&mdash;The
brevity of my plan impels me to other subjects.
There is one quality, difficult to define, yet easily understood,
which always affects us pleasantly. It is a
quality as rare as its effects are useful; and yet we have
scarcely a specific term in our language by which fully
to designate it. An obliging disposition is the common
phrase that conveys it. Examine all the pleasant things
of life, and you will find this disposition the pleasantest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of all. There often remains no memory of the benefits
received. Of those we have rendered, something is always
retained.</p>

<p>But what shall we say of the ungrateful? We are
told that they are formidable from their numbers and
boldness, and that they people the whole earth. How
eccentric and contradictory are the common maxims of
the world! We admit that we have a right to exact
gratitude; and yet wish that benefits should be forgotten:
I hold it wrong to depend upon gratitude,
since the expectation will generally be deceived.&mdash;On
the contrary, I approve his course, who keeps an
exact account of his good actions. In reading the
record, he will one day taste a legitimate reward. What
reading can be so useful? To remember that we have
done good in time past, is to bind us to beneficence in
time to come. We hear it continually repeated, that it
requires a sublime effort to do good to our enemies.&mdash;Men
more zealous than enlightened have advanced, that
the morality of the gospel has alone prescribed the rendering
of good for evil. Evangelical duty is sufficiently
elevated by being founded on the basis of higher sanctions
and a future retribution; and rests not its claims upon
new discoveries of what is true, beautiful and obligatory
in morals. They who advocate that the grand maxims
of evangelical morality are found nowhere else than in
the gospel, seem to me to have committed two faults;
the one in advancing an error, the other in tending to estrange
men from the virtues they inculcate, by intimating
that their practice exacts more than human power.</p>

<p>A writer of unquestionable piety, the late Sir William
Jones found the grand maxim, ‘do unto others as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
would wish them to do unto you,’ implied in the
discourses of Lysias, Thales and Pittacus, and, word for
word, in the original of Confucius. The obligation <em>to
render good for evil</em>, he affirms, is inculcated in the religious
books of the Hindoos and Arabians; in confirmation
of which he cites many passages from them. The
sentiment of moralists has everywhere been graven upon
the human heart. It is enough that our Lord has
sanctioned the sublime precepts that belong to our faith
with immortal recompenses; and still more may we rely
upon those sanctions, when we add to them the present
pleasure of performing good actions.<a name="NOTEanchor_27a" id="NOTEanchor_27a"></a><a href="#NOTE_27a" class="fnanchor">[27a]</a></p>

<p>Let us add, that in enjoining the gospel maxim <em>to render
good for evil</em>, we inculcate elevation of mind, the
source of all the virtues. But christian moralists have
too often been tempted to neutralize or destroy the effect
of their precepts, by pushing them to absurd or impracticable
lengths. To practise forgiveness, and to do good,
are evangelical commands, as sublime as they are conformable
to our natural views of duty. To enjoin upon
us to degrade ourselves in the estimate of our enemies,
by feeling and acting towards them as though they were
our friends, as some have understood the bearing of the
christian precept, would be injurious and impracticable.
Socrates pardoned his enemies, but preserved an imposing
dignity. There was no abasement in the infinitely
higher example of him, who, suffering on the cross,
prayed for his murderers.</p>

<p>If such are our obligations as men and Christians towards
our enemies, what duties ought we not to fulfil to
those benefactors who have steadily sought occasions to
be useful to us, to ward off danger from us, and to repair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
our misfortunes? To such let us seek incessant
opportunities of acquitting our debt. Gratitude will
prolong the pleasure conferred by their benefits.</p>

<p>Indulgence, and the desire to oblige, seem to me the
two principal means of conciliating to ourselves the affections
of our kind. A virtue which at least commands their
esteem is integrity. Not only is he who practises it, faithful
to his engagements, since he allows no promises of his to be
held slight, but his uprightness makes itself felt in all his
actions, and frankness in all his conversation. The faults
that he commits he is prompt to acknowledge; he confesses
them without false shame, and seeks neither to
exaggerate nor extenuate them. Touching the interests
which are common to him and other people, he decides
for simple justice; and, in so awarding, does not
deem that he injures himself, his first possession being
his own self-respect. Without rendering me high services,
he obliges me in the lesser charities, and procures
me one of the most vivid pleasures I can taste, that of
contemplating a noble character.</p>

<p>Among the virtues which ought to secure a kind regard,
we universally assign to modesty a high rank. A simple
and modest man lives unknown, until a moment, which
he could not have foreseen, reveals his estimable qualities
and his generous actions. I compare him to the
concealed flower springing from an humble stem, which
escapes the view, and is discovered only by its perfume.
Pride quickly fixes the eye, and he who is always his
own eulogist, dispenses every other person from the obligation
to praise him. A truly modest man, emerging
from his transient obscurity, will obtain those delightful
praises which the heart awards without effort. His superiority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
far from being importunate, will become attractive.
Modesty gives to talents and virtues the same
charm which chastity adds to beauty.</p>

<p>Let us carry into the world neither curiosity nor indiscretion.
Curiosity is the defect of a little mind, which,
not knowing how to employ itself at home, feels the necessity
of being amused with the occupations of others.
In relation to minute objects it is ridiculous. In important
affairs it becomes odious. Let us know nothing
about those debates, piques and parties, which it is not
in our power to settle.</p>

<p>An attribute so precious, that, in my eye, it becomes
a virtue, is a gentle and constant equality of temper.&mdash;To
sustain it, not only exacts a pure mind, but a vigor
of understanding which resists the petty vexations and
fleeting contrarieties which a multitude of objects and
events are continually bringing. What an unalterable
charm does it give to the society of the man who possesses
it! How is it possible to avoid loving him whom we are
certain always to find with serenity on his brow and a
smile in his countenance?</p>

<p>I foresee that our brilliant observers, as they run over
these precepts, will say to me, ‘you resemble those philosophers
who trace the plan of a republic, without taking
into the account the passions of men or the state of
society; a thousand times more unreasonable, than those
writers of romance who publish their dreams as dreams.
Your maxims upon indulgence will only awaken for you
the pity due to good natured weakness. The maxim
of the world is, be adroit to seize upon defects, and
prompt to censure the weaknesses of men, that you may
intimidate those who can only serve to annoy you; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
give up to ridicule those who can only amuse you. Make
a display of your desire to oblige. Pronounce sentimental
phrases with grace. Make dupes if you can; but
take care that you do not become one yourself, by having
your own maxims practised upon you. Credit is not revenue,
but a sum which becomes exhausted in proportion
as you spend upon it, without replacing it. Ought
I to be modest when so many examples prove that talents
are a small thing, if there be not subjoined the
happy talent of making them known. The man who
speaks of himself with modesty is believed upon his
word; and when I search for the causes of that admiration
which certain personages have obtained, I can discover
no other than the long obstinacy and persevering
intrepidity which they have put in requisition to praise
themselves. There are eulogies which men give themselves,
of which, as of the calumnies that they wipe out,
some traces will always remain. Finally, opinion alone
renders our qualities estimable; and he who, with a view
to succeed, should immediately cultivate the tawdry virtues
which you celebrate, would be as ridiculous as he
who should appear in society in the costume worn a century
ago.’ They who say this are as right, in their views,
as I am in mine. If the interest with which our kind inspires
us, if our virtues cannot shield us from injustice, let
us hold ourselves aloof from opinion, and while we allow
the multitude their way of thinking, let it not disturb our
repose. Among the circumstances essential to felicity, I
count the attachment of some individuals, but not popularity.</p>

<span class="fs70">OF MARRIAGE.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Since we cannot assure ourselves of the general affection,
nor even of the justice of men, it becomes our interest,
in the midst of the great mass, that we cannot move, to
create a little world, which we can arrange at the disposal
of our reason and affections.</p>

<p>In this retreat, dictated to us alike by our instincts
and our hearts, let us forget the chimeras which the
crowd pursue; and if the men of fashion and the world
stare, ridicule, and even condemn us, let their murmurs
sound in our ears as the dashing of the waves on the
distant shore, to the stranger, under the hospitable roof
which shelters him from the storm.</p>

<p>The universe of reason and affection must be composed
of a single family. Of that universe a wedded
pair must be the centre. A wife is the best and the only
disinterested friend, by the award of nature. She remains
such, when fortune has scattered all others. How
many have been recalled to hope by a virtuous and affectionate
wife, when all beside had been lost! How
many, retrieved from utter despondency, have felt in an
ineffable effusion of heart, that conjugal heroism and constancy
were an ample indemnity for the deprivation of all
other good things! How many, undeceived by external
illusions, have in this way been brought home to their
real good! If we wish to see the attributes of conjugal
heroism, in their purest brilliancy, let us suppose the husband
in the last degree of wretchedness. Let us imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
him not only culpable, but so estimated, and an
outcast from society. Repentance itself, in the view of
candor, has not been available to cloak his faults. She
alone, accusing him not, is only prodigal of consolations.
Embracing duties as severe as his reverses,
she voluntarily shares his captivity or exile. He
finds still, on the faithful bosom of innocence, a refuge,
where remorse becomes appeased; as in former
days, the proscribed found, at the foot of the
altar, an asylum against the fury of men.</p>

<p>Marriage is generally assumed as a means of increasing
credit and fortune, and of assuring success in the
world. It should be undertaken as a chief element of
happiness, in the retirement of domestic repose.<a name="NOTEanchor_28" id="NOTEanchor_28"></a><a href="#NOTE_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I
would wish that my disciple, while still in the freshness
of youth, might have reason and experience enough to
select the beloved person, whom he would desire one
day to espouse. I would hope, that, captivated with
her dawning qualities, and earnestly seeking her happiness,
he might win her tenderness, and find his satisfaction
in training her to a conformity to his tastes, habits
and character.</p>

<p>The freshness of her docile nature demands his first
forming cares. As she advances in life she is moulded
to happy changes, adapted to supply his defects. She
is reared modest, amiable, instructed, respectable, and
respected; one day to govern his family, and direct
his house, by diffusing around the domestic domain,
order and peace. Let neither romances, metaphysics,
pedantry nor fashion render a qualification for these important
duties, either trifling or vulgar in her view. Still,
domestic duties are by no means to occupy all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
hours. The time which is not devoted to them will flow
quietly on in friendly circles, not numerous, but animated
by gayety, friendship and the inexplicable pleasures
which spring from intercourse with rational society.
There are, also, more unimportant duties, which we
expect her not to neglect. We wish her to occupy some
moments at a toilet; where simplicity should be the basis
of elegance; and where native tact might develope
the graces, and vary, and multiply, if I may so say, the
forms of her beauty. In fine, the versatility of her
modes of rendering herself agreeable, should increase
the chances of always escaping ennui in her presence.</p>

<p>But train women to visit a library as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i>, and they
will be likely to bring from it pedantry without solid instruction;
and coquetry without feminine amiability.
I would not be understood to question the capability of
the female understanding. I am not sure that I would
wish the wife of my friend to have been an author,
though some of the most amiable and enlightened women
have been such. But I deem that in their mental
constitution, and in the assignment of their lot, providence
has designated them to prefer the graces to
erudition; and that to acquire a wreath of laurels, they
must ordinarily relinquish their native crown of roses.<a name="NOTEanchor_28a" id="NOTEanchor_28a"></a><a href="#NOTE_28a" class="fnanchor">[28a]</a>
When we see a husband and wife thus united by
tenderness, good hearts and simple tastes, everything
presages for them a delightful futurity. Let them live
contented in their retirement. Instead of wishing to
blazon, let them conceal their happiness, and exist for
each other. Life will become to them the happiest of
dreams.</p>

<p>Perhaps the world will say, ‘you speak, it may be, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
such a wife as you would be understood to possess
yourself. But you do not paint marriage in the abstract,
while you thus describe happiness as finding a
habitation within the domestic walls, and pain and sorrow
without: how many people find eternal ennui at
home, and respire pleasure, only when they have fled
their own threshold.’ There are few wives so perfect,
says La Bruyere, ‘as to hinder their husbands from repenting
at least once in a day, that they have a wife; or
from envying the happiness of him who has none.’</p>

<p>This sentence, instead of containing a just observation,
is only an epigram. In looking round a circle of individuals,
ridiculously called the world, we shall find happy
family establishments less rare than we imagine. Besides,
it would be absurd to count among unhappy unions,
all those which are not wholly exempt from stormy passions.
Not only is perfect felicity a chimerical expectation
on the earth, but we meet with many people who
would be fatigued into ennui in a perfect calm, and who
require a little of the spice of contrariety to season the
repast of life. I would not covet their taste; but there
are modes of being singular, which, without imparting
happiness, procure pleasures. Finally, supposing the
number of unhappy marriages to be as immense as is
contended, what is the conclusion? The great majority
adopting, as maxims of life, principles so different
from mine, it would be strange if they obtained such
results as I desire.</p>

<p>In these days, the deciding motive with parents, in
relation to marriage, is interest; and, what seems to me
revolting in the spirit of the age, is, that the young have
also learned to calculate. When a man marries simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
on a speculation of interest, if he sees his fortune and
distinction secured, reign disorder and alienation in his
house as they may, he is still happier than he deserves
to be.</p>

<p>Our marriages of inclination guaranty happiness no
more than our marriages of interest. What results
should be anticipated from the blind impulse of appetite?
Let there be mutual affection, such as reason can survey
with a calm and severe scrutiny. Such love as is painted
in romances is but a fatal fever. It is children alone
who believe themselves in love, only when they feel
themselves in a delirium. They have imagined that
life should be a continual ecstasy; and these indulged
dreams of anticipation spoil the reality of wedded life.
I have supposed the husband older than his wife. I have
imagined him forming the character of his young, fair
and docile companion; and that, so to speak, they have
become assimilated to each other’s tastes and habits.
The right combination of reason and love assures for
them, under such circumstances, as much as possible,
a futurity of happiness.</p>

<p>I might here speak of the misery of jealousy and infidelity,
and the comparative guilt of these vices in the
husband and the wife. But these are sources of torment
only in unions contracted and sustained by the maxims
and the spirit of the world. According to my views
these crimes could not mar the marriages which were
undertaken from right motives, and under the approving
sanction of severe reason. I, therefore, pass them by,
as not belonging to my subject; and as supposing that
when marriage is the result of wise foresight and regulated
choice, and when its duties are discharged from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
proper sense of their obligation, such faults can not
occur.</p>

<p>Another cause of disunion springs from the proud
temper of some wives. They erroneously and obstinately
persuade themselves that fidelity includes all their duty.
More than one husband, incessantly tormented by an
imperious and capricious wife, feels almost disposed to
envy the gentle spouse who sleeps pleasantly under deceitful
caresses. As much as an honest man ought to
avoid crimes, in order to merit his reputation and sustain
it, ought the highest meed awarded to women to be bestowed,
not on those alone who are chaste, but on those
who know how to watch over the happiness of their
family by eager attentions and studious cares.</p>

<p>This petulance of temper is commonly supposed to be
a conjoined attribute of conjugal fidelity. I have sometimes
seen wives both peevish and coquettish, and I cannot
imagine a more odious combination. If we despise
the man who is rough and slovenly at home, and becomes
charming in society, what sentiment does that
wife merit who wears out her husband’s patience with
her arrogance, and puts on seducing graces, and affects
sensibility, in the presence of strangers?</p>

<p>I have often heard men who were sensible upon every
other subject, express their conviction that the orientals,
in excluding their women from all eyes but their own,
had established the only reasonable domestic policy.
There is no more wit than humanity in this barbarous
sentiment, however frequently it is uttered. No one
could be in earnest, in wishing to copy, into free institutions,
this appalling vestige of slavery. But my inward
respect for women withholds me from flattering them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Authority ought to belong to the husband; and the influence
of tenderness, graces and the charms of constancy,
gentleness and truth, constituting the appropriate
female empire, belongs of right to the wife. I take
leave to illustrate this phrase. Masculine vigor, and
aptitude to contend and resist, clearly indicate that nature
has confided authority to man. To dispossess him
of it, and control him by a still more irresistible sway,
it is necessary that the feeble sex should learn patience,
docility, passive courage, and the management of their
appropriate weapons in danger and sorrow, and to become
energetic for the endurance of the peaceful cares
of the domestic establishment. Man is formed by nature
for the calls of active courage; and woman, for the
appalling scenes of pain and affliction, and the agony of
the sick and dying bed. In a word, all argument apart,
nature has clearly demonstrated to which sex authority
belongs.</p>

<p>I discover that the defects of man spring from the
tendency of his natural traits, in which force predominates,
to run to excess. I see his gentle companion
endowed with attributes and qualities naturally tending
to temper his defects. The means she has received to
reach this end announce that it is the purpose of nature
that she should use them with this view. She has
charms which, when rightly applied, none can resist.
Her character is a happy compound of sensibility, wisdom
and levity. She has superadded a felicity of address
which she owes to her organization, and which
the reserve, that her education imposes, serves to develope.
Thus the qualities, and even the imperfections
of the two sexes serve to bring them together. It follows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that man should possess authority, and woman
influence, for their mutual happiness.</p>

<p>When the wife commands, I cease to behold a respectable
married pair. I see a ridiculous tyrant, and a still
more ridiculous slave. It is vain to urge that she may
be most capable of authority, and that her orders may
be conformable to wisdom and justice. They are absurd,
from the very circumstance that they are orders.
The virtues which the husband ought to practise towards
his wife must have their origin in love, which can
only be inspired, and which flies all restraint. In a
single position, the wife honors herself in assuming authority.
It is when reverses have overwhelmed and
desolated her husband, so that, ceasing to sustain her
and changing the natural order, she supports him.
Grant that he receives hope as her gift; grant that he is
compelled to blush in imitating her example of courage;
she aspires to this power no longer than to be able to restore
him to the place whence misery had cast him down.<a name="NOTEanchor_30" id="NOTEanchor_30"></a><a href="#NOTE_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It is a truth that ought not to be contested, that dissatisfied
husbands and wives often love each other more
than they imagine. Suppose them to believe themselves
indifferent; and to seem so; and even on the
verge of mutual hate; should one of them fall sick, we
see the other inspired with sincere alarms. Suppose
them on the eve of separation; when the fatal moment
comes, both recoil from the act. Habit almost causes
the pains, to which we have been long accustomed, to
become cause of regret when they cease. When the
two begin mutually to complain of their destiny, I counsel
each, instead of wishing to criminate and correct
each other, to give each other an example of mutual
forbearance and indulgence. It may be, that the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of their mutual dissatisfaction is unreal; the supposed
wrong not intended, the suspicion false. Candor and
forgiveness will appease all. The husband may have
gone astray only in thought; which is beyond human
privilege to fathom. The wife may have minor defects
and an unequal temper, without forfeiting much
excellence and many remaining claims to be loved.
The morbid influence of ill health and irresistible temperament,
in their powerful action upon the temper,
may have been the source whence the faults flowed
on either part; and the mutual wrongs may thus
have been, in some sense, independent of the will
of the parties. Bound, as they are, in such intimate
and almost indissoluble relations, before they give that
happiness, which they hoped and promised, to the winds,
let them exhaust their efforts of self-command and mutual
indulgence, to bring back deep and true affection.</p>

<p>The purest happiness of earth is, unquestionably, the
portion of two beings wisely and fitly united in the bonds
of indissoluble confidence and affection. What a touching
picture does Madame de Stael present in these lines:
‘I saw, during my sojourn in England, a man of the
highest merit united to a wife worthy of him. One day,
as we were walking together, we met some of those
people that the English call gipseys, who generally wander
about in the woods in the most deplorable condition.
I expressed pity for them thus enduring the union of all
the physical evils of nature. “Had it been necessary,”
said the affectionate husband, pointing to his wife, “in
order to spend my life with her, that I should have
passed thirty years in begging with them, we would still
have been happy.” “Yes,” responded the wife, “the
happiest of beings.”’</p>

<span class="fs70">CHILDREN.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>One of the happiest days, and, perhaps, the most
beautiful of life, is when the birth of a child opens the
heart of the parent to emotions, as yet, unknown.<a name="NOTEanchor_31" id="NOTEanchor_31"></a><a href="#NOTE_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Yet
what torments are prepared by this epoch! What painful
anxiety, what agonies their sufferings excite! What
terror, when we fear for their infant life! These alarms
terminate not with their early age. The inquietude with
which their parents watch over their destiny fills every
period of their life to their last sigh.</p>

<p>The compensating satisfaction which they bring must
be very vivid, since it counterbalances so many sufferings.
In order to love them, we have no need to be
convinced that they will respond to our cares, and one
day repay them. If there be in the human heart one
disinterested sentiment, it is parental love. Our tenderness
for our children is independent of reflection. We
love them because they are our children. Their existence
makes a part of ours; or, rather, is more than ours.
All that is either useful or pleasant to them, brings us a
pure happiness, springing from their health, their gayety,
their amusements.</p>

<p>The chief end which we ought to propose to ourselves,
in rearing them, is to train and dispose them so that
they may wisely enjoy that existence which is accorded
them. Of all the happy influences which can be brought
to bear upon their mind and manners, none is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
beneficial than the example of parental gentleness. The
good Plutarch most eloquently advanced this doctrine
in ancient time. Montaigne, Rousseau, M’Kenzie, and
various writers of minor fame among the moderns, have
reproduced his ideas, and, by their authority, have finally
effected a happy revolution in education. I delight to
trace the most important ideas thus reproduced by enlightened
and noble minds in different ages. It is chiefly
by persevering in the system of the influence of gentleness
that we may expect an ultimate melioration in the
human character and condition.</p>

<p>But scarcely has any such salutary change been effected,
before minds, either superficial or soured, see
only the inconveniences which accompany it; and, instead
of evading or correcting them, would return to the
point whence they started. We hear people regretting
the decline of the severity of ancient education; and
maintaining the wisdom of those contrarieties and vexations
which children used to experience; ‘a fitting discipline
of preparation,’ say they, ‘to prepare them for the
sorrows of life.’ Would they, on the same principle, inflict
bruises and contusions, to train them to the right endurance
of those that carelessness or accident might bring?
‘It is an advantage,’ say they, ‘to put them to an apprenticeship
of pain at the period when the sorrow it
inflicts is light and transient.’ This mode of speaking,
with many others of similar import, presents a combination
of much error with some truth.</p>

<p>The sufferings of childhood seem to us trifling and
easy to endure, because time has interposed distance
between them and us; and we have no fear of ever
meeting them again. It does not cease to be a fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that the child that passes a year under the discipline of
the ferule of a severe master, is as unhappy as a man
deprived a year of his liberty. The latter, in truth, has
less reason to complain; since he ought to find, in the
discipline of his reason, and his maturity and force of
character, more powerful motives for patient endurance.
Parents! Providence has placed the destiny of your
children in your hands. When you thus sacrifice the
present to an uncertain future, you ought to have strong
proof that you will put at their disposal the means of
indemnification. If the sacrifice of the present to the
future were indispensable, I would not dissuade from it.
But my conviction is, that the best means of preparing
them for the future may be found in rendering them as
happy as possible for the present. If it should be your
severe trial to be deprived of them in their early days,
you will, at least, have the consolation of being able to
say, ‘I have rendered them happy during the short time
they were confided to me.’ Strive then, by gentleness,
guided by wisdom and authority, to cast the sunshine of
enjoyment upon the necessary toils and studies of the
morning of their existence.</p>

<p>It is the stern award of nature to bring them sorrows.
Our task is to soothe them. I feel an interest when I
see the child regret the trinket it has broken, or the bird
it has reared. Nature in this way, gives them the first
lessons of pain, and strengthens them to sustain the more
bitter losses of maturer days. Let us prudently second
the efforts of nature; and to console the weeping child,
let us not attempt to change the course of these fugitive
ideas, nor to efface the vexation by a pleasure. In unavoidable
suffering let the dawning courage and reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
find strength for endurance. Let us first share the regrets,
and gently bring the sufferer to feel the inutility of
tears. Let us accustom him not to throw away his
strength in useless efforts; and let us form his mind to
bear without a murmur the yoke of necessity. These
maxims, I am aware, are directly against the spirit of
modern education, which is almost entirely directed towards
the views of ambition.</p>

<p>But while I earnestly inculcate gentleness in parental
discipline, I would not confound it with weakness. I
disapprove that familiarity between parents and children
which is unfavorable to subordination. Fashion is likely
to introduce an injurious equality into this relation.
I see the progress of this dangerous effeminacy with regret.
The dress and expenditures which would formerly
have supplied ten children, scarcely satisfy at present
the caprices of one. This foolish complaisance of parents
prepares, for the future husbands and wives, a task
most difficult to fulfil. Let us not, by anticipating and
preventing the wishes of children, teach them to be indolent
in searching for their own pleasures. Their age
is fertile in this species of invention. That they may
be successful in seizing enjoyment, little more is requisite
to be performed on our part than to break their
chains.</p>

<p>There are two fruitful sources of torments for children.
One is, what the present day denominates politeness.
It is revolting to me to see children early trained
to forego their delightful frankness and simplicity, and
learning artificial manners. We wish them to become
little personages; and we compel them to receive tiresome
compliments, and to repeat insignificant formulas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of common-place flattery. In this way, politeness, destined
to impart amenity to life, becomes a source of
vexation and restraint. It would seem as if we thought
it so important a matter to teach the usages of society, that
they could never be known unless the study were commenced
in infancy. Besides, do we flatter ourselves,
that we shall be able to teach children the modes and
the vocabulary of politeness, without initiating them, at
the same time, in the rudiments of falsehood? They
are compelled to see that we consider it a trifle. If we
wish them to become flatterers and dishonest, I ask
what more efficient method we could take?</p>

<p>Labor is the second source of their sufferings. I
would by no means be understood to dissuade from the
assiduous cultivation of habits of industry. You may
enable children to remove mountains, if you will contrive
to render their tasks a matter of amusement and interest.
The extreme curiosity of children announces an
instinctive desire for instruction. But instead of profiting
by it, we adopt measures which tend to stifle it. We
render their studies tiresome, and then say that the young
naturally tire of study.</p>

<p>When the parent is sufficiently enlightened to rear his
child himself, instead of plying him with rudimental
books, dictionaries and restraint, let him impart the first
instructions by familiar conversation. Ideas advanced
in this way are accommodated to the comprehension of
the pupil, by mutual good feeling rendered attractive,
and brought directly within the embrace of his mind.
This instruction leads him to observe, and accustoms
him to compare, reflect and discriminate, offers the
sciences under interesting associations, and inspires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a natural thirst for instruction. Of all results which education
can produce, this is the most useful. A youth
of fifteen, trained in this way, will come into possession
of more truths, mixed with fewer errors, than much
older persons reared in the common way. He will be
distinguished by the early maturity of his reason, and by
his eagerness to cultivate the sciences, which, instead of
producing fatigue or disgust, will every day give birth to
new ideas and new pleasures. I am nevertheless little
surprised, that the scrupulous advocates of the existing
routine should insist that such a method tends to form
superficial thinkers. I can only say to these profound
panegyrists of the present order of instruction, that the
method which I recommend, was that of the Greeks.&mdash;Their
philosophers taught while walking in the shade of
the portico or of trees, and were ignorant of the art of
rendering study tiresome, and not disposed to throw
over it the benefits of constraint. Modern instructers
ought, therefore, to find that they were shallow reasoners,
and that their poets and artists could have produced
only crude and unfinished efforts.<a name="NOTEanchor_33" id="NOTEanchor_33"></a><a href="#NOTE_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Besides, this part of education is of trifling importance,
compared with the paramount obligation to give
the pupil robust health, pure morals, and an energetic
mind. I deeply regret that the despotic empire of
opinion is more powerful than paternal love. Instead of
gravely teaching to your son the little arts of shining in
the world, have the courage to say to him, ‘oblige those
of thy kind whose sufferings thou canst lighten, and exhibit
a constant and universal example of good morals.
Form, every evening, projects necessary for enjoying a
happy and useful succeeding day.’ Thus you will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
him useful, good and happy, if not great in the world’s
estimation. You will behold him peacefully descending
the current of time. In striking the balance with life,
he will be able to say, I have known only those sufferings
which no wisdom could evade, and no efforts repel.
But such are the prejudices of the age, to give such
counsels to a son requires rare and heroic courage.</p>

<p>Is not that filial ingratitude, of which parents so generally
complain, the bitter fruit of their own training?&mdash;You
fill their hearts with mercenary passions, and with
measureless ambition. You break the tenderest ties,
and send them to distant public schools. Your children,
in turn, put your lessons to account, and abandon your
importunate and declining age, if you depend on them,
to mercenary hands. When they were young, you ridiculed
them out of their innocent recklessness, and frankness,
and want of worldly wisdom. You vaunted to
them that ambition and those arts of rising, which, put in
practice, have steeled their hearts against filial piety, as
well as the other affections that belong not to calculation.
Since the paramount object of your training was
to teach them to shine, and make the most out of every
body, you have at least a right to expect from their vanity,
pompous funeral solemnities. I revere that indication
of infinite wisdom, that has rendered the love of the
parent more anxious and tender than that of the child.
The intensity of the affections ought to be proportionate
to the wants of the beings that excite them. But ingratitude
is not in nature. Better training would have produced
other manners. In rearing our children with
more enlightened care, in inspiring them with moderate
desires, in reducing their eagerness for brilliancy and distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
we shall render them happy, without stifling
their natural filial sentiments; and we shall thus use the
best means of training them to sustain and soothe our last
moments, as we embellished their first days.<a name="NOTEanchor_34" id="NOTEanchor_34"></a><a href="#NOTE_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<span class="fs70">OF FRIENDSHIP.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Let us bring within the family circle a few persons of
amiable manners and simple tastes. Our domestic retreat
may then become our universe. But we must
search for real friends, with capabilities for continuing
such. If interest and pleasure break the accidental ties
of a day, shall friendship, which was always a stranger
to the connexion, be accused of the infraction?</p>

<p>A real friend must not be expected from the common
ties of vulgar interest; but must be, in the circle to which
he belongs, as a brother of adoption. So simple should
be our confidence in the entireness of his affection, and the
disinterestedness and wisdom of his advice, as to incline
us to consult him without afflicting our wife or children
by a useless communication of our perplexities. To him
we should be able to confide our fears; and while we
struggle, by his advice and aid to escape the pressing
evil which menaces to overwhelm us, our family may
still repose in tranquil security.<a name="NOTEanchor_35" id="NOTEanchor_35"></a><a href="#NOTE_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>If he suffer in turn, we share his pains. If he have
pleasures, we reciprocally enjoy them. If either party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
experience reverses, instead of finding himself alone in
misery, he receives consolations so touching and tender,
that he ceases to complain of a lot which has enabled
him to become acquainted with the depth of the resources
of friendship.</p>

<p>How pure is the sentiment, how simple the pleasures,
which flow from the intercourse of two men united by
similar opinions and like desires, who have both cultivated
letters, the arts, and true wisdom! With what
rapidity the moments of these charming conversations
fly! Even the hours consecrated to study are less
pleasant, perhaps less instructive. Such a friend, so to
speak, is of a different nature from that of the rest of
men. They either conceal our defects, or cause us to
see them from motives of ill feeling. A friend so discusses
them, in our presence, as not to wound us. He
kindly reproaches us with faults, to our face, which he
extenuates, or excuses before others in our absence.
We can never fully comprehend to what extent a friend
may be useful and dear until after having been a long
time the faithful companion of his good and evil fortune.
What emotions we experience in giving ourselves up to
the remembrance of the common perils, storms and
trials we have experienced together! It is never without
tenderness of heart that we say, ‘we have had the same
thoughts, affections and hopes. Such an event penetrated
us with common joy; such another filled us
with grief. Uniting our efforts, we rescued a victim
of poverty and misfortune. We mutually shared
his tears of gratitude. The hard necessity of circumstances
separated us; and our paths so diverged that
seas and mountains divided us. But we still remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
present to each other, in communion of thought. He
had fears for me, and I for him, as we foresaw each
other’s dangers. I learned his condition, interpreted
his thoughts and feelings, and said, ‘such a fear agitates
him; he forms such a project, conceives such a hope.’
Finally, we met again. What charms, what effusion of
heart in the union!’</p>

<p>It is a puerile absurdity to be proud of the reputation
of one to whom we are united by the ties of blood&mdash;a
distinction which nature gave us. But we may be
justly proud of the rare qualities of our friend. The
ties of this relation are not the work of nature or contingency.
We prove that, in meriting his esteem, we, at
least, resemble him in the qualities of his heart.</p>

<p>I immediately form a high opinion of the man whom
I hear earnest in the applause of the talents or virtues
of his friend. He possesses the qualities which he applauds;
since he has need to affirm their existence in
the person he loves.</p>

<p>This noble and pure sentiment has had its peaceable
heroes. What names, what examples could I not cite,
in ancient and in modern times! What splendid and
affecting proofs of identity of fortune, joys and sorrows,
and even danger and death! I knew two friends, of
whom every one spoke with respect. One of them was
asked the extent of his fortune? ‘Mine is small,’ he
replied, ‘but my friend is rich.’ The other, a few days
before he died of a contagious disease, asked, ‘why so
many persons were allowed to enter his chamber? No
one,’ he added, ‘ought to be admitted but my friend.’
Thus were they one in fortune, in life and in death.<a name="NOTEanchor_36" id="NOTEanchor_36"></a><a href="#NOTE_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>I deem, that even moralists have sought to render
this peaceable sentiment, this gentle affection, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
only one exempt from storms, too exclusive. I am
aware, how much our affections become enfeebled, in
proportion as their objects multiply. There is force in the
quaint expression of an old author. ‘Love is like a large
stream which bears heavy laden boats. Divide it into
many channels, and they run aground.’ Still, we may
give the honored name of friend to several, without profaning
it, if there exist between us mutual sympathy,
high esteem and tender interest; if our pleasures and
pains are, in some sense, common stock, and we are
reciprocally capable of a sincere devotion to each other’s
welfare. As much, however, as I revere the real sentiment,
I am disgusted by the sickly or exaggerated affectation
of it.</p>

<p>The sentiment is still more delightful when inspired
by a woman. I shall be asked, if it can exist in its
purity between persons of the different sexes? I answer
in the affirmative, when the impulses of youth no longer
agitate the heart. We then experience the whole charm
of the sentiment, as the difference of sex, which is never
entirely forgotten, imparts to it a vague and touching
tenderness and an ideal delight for which language is too
poor to furnish terms.</p>

<p>Why can love and friendship, the sunshine of existence,
decay in the heart? Why are they not eternal?
But since it is not so, if we are cruelly deceived in our
affections, the surest means of medicating our pain is,
instead of cherishing misanthropic distrust, to look round
and form the same generous ties anew. Has your friend
abandoned you? or, worse, has your wife become unworthy
of your love? It is better to be deceived a thousand
times than to add, to the grief of wounded affection, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
insupportable burden of general distrust, misanthropy
and hatred. Let these baneful feelings never usurp the
place of those sentiments which must constitute human
happiness. Pardon to those by whom you have been
loved, the sorrows which their abandonment has caused
you, in consideration of those days of the past which was
embellished by their friendship.</p>

<p>But these treasons and perfidies are only frequent in
the intercourse of those who are driven about by the
whirlwinds of life; in which so many opposing interests,
so many deceitful pleasures confuse and separate men.
The simple minded and good, whose days flow pleasantly
in retreat, every day value more the price of those
ties that unite them. Their happiness is veiled and
guarantied by a guardian obscurity.</p>

<p>I give place to none of the illusions of inexperience
in regard to men.<a name="NOTEanchor_37" id="NOTEanchor_37"></a><a href="#NOTE_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The errors, contradictions and
vices with which they are charged, exist. I admit that
the greater part of satires are faithful paintings. But
there are still to be found, everywhere, persons whose
manners are frank, whose heart is good, and whose temper
amiable. These persons exist in sufficient numbers
to compose this new world of which I have spoken.
Writers are disposed to declaim against men. I have
never ceased to feel good will towards my kind. I
have chosen only to withdraw from the multitude, in
order to select my position in the centre of a small society.
For me there are no longer stupid or wicked
people on the earth.</p>

<p>I have examined the essential things of life, tranquillity
and independence of mind, health, competence and
the affection of some of our kind. I wish now to give my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
observations something more of detail and diversity.
But I wish it still to be borne in mind, that I give only
the materials and outlines of an essay, and make no pretensions
to fill out a complete treatise. I wish that a
temple may be raised to happiness. Hands, more skilful
than mine, will rear it. It is sufficient to my purpose
to indicate those delightful sites, in the midst of
which it may be erected.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PLEASURES OF THE SENSES.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>Nature has decreed, that each one of our senses
should be a source of pleasure. But if we seek our
enjoyment, only in physical sensations, the same stern
arbiter has enacted, that our capability of pleasure should
soon be exhausted, and that, palled and disgusted, we
should die without having known true happiness.<a name="NOTEanchor_38" id="NOTEanchor_38"></a><a href="#NOTE_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Exactly in proportion as pleasures are less associated
with the mind, their power to give us any permanent
satisfaction is diminished. On the contrary, they
become vivid and durable, precisely in the degree in
which they awaken and call forth moral ideas. They
become celestial, when they connect the past with the
present, the present with the future, and the whole with
heaven.</p>

<p>In proportion as we scrutinize the pleasures of the
senses, we shall always find their charm increasing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the same degree, as losing, if I may so say, their physical
stain, they rise in the scale of purification, and become
transformed, in some sense, to the dignity of moral
enjoyments.</p>

<p>I look at a painting: it represents an old man, a
child, a woman giving alms, and a soldier, whose attitude
expresses astonishment. I admire the fidelity,
the truth and coloring of the picture; and my eye is
intensely gratified. But remaining ignorant of the subject,
I go away, and the whole shortly vanishes from my
memory. I see it again; and am now struck with the
inscription at the bottom, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Date obolum Belisario</i>.’ I remember
an interesting passage of history. A crowd of
moral images throng upon my spirit: I soften to tenderness;
and I comprehend the affecting lesson, which the artist
is giving me. I review the painting, again and again;
and thrill at the view of the blind warrior, and of the child
holding out his helmet to receive alms.</p>

<p>When we travel, those points of view in the landscape
which long fix our eye, are those which awaken ideas
of innocence and peace; affecting the heart with associations
connected with the morning of our life; or ideas
of that power and immensity, which move and elevate
the soul. The paintings of nature, as well as those of
men, are thus capable of being embellished by moral associations.
In travelling, I perceive a delightful isle
embosomed in a peaceful lake. While I contemplate
it, with the simple pleasure excited by a charming landscape,
I am told that it is inhabited by a happy pair,
who were long crossed and separated; but who wore
out the persevering opposition of fortune; and are now
living there in the innocence and peace of the first tenants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of paradise. How different an interest the landscape
now assumes! I behold the happy pair, without care or
regret, sheltered from jealous observation, enjoying the
dream of their happy love, gratefully contemplating the
Author of the beautiful nature around them, and elevating
their love and their hearts, as a sacrifice to <span class="fs70">HIM</span>.</p>

<p>Sites, which, in themselves, have no peculiar charm,
become most beautiful as soon as they awaken touching
remembrances. Suppose yourself cast by misfortune
on the care of a stranger in a strange land. He attempts
to dispel your dejection, and says, ‘these countries
are hospitable, and nature here puts forth all her
opulence; come, and enjoy it with us.’ The gay landscapes,
which spread before you, all assume the appearance
of strangers; and offer no attractions. But while
your eye traverses the scenery with indifference, you
see blue hills melting into the distant horizon. No person
remarks them, but yourself. They resemble the
mountains of your own country, the scenes upon which
your infant view first rested. You turn away to conceal
the new emotions, and your eyes are filling with
tears. You continue to gaze fondly on those hills, dear
to memory. In the midst of a rich landscape, they are
all that interests you. You return to review them every
day, and demand of them their treasured remembrances
and illusions,&mdash;the dearest pleasures of your exile.<a name="NOTEanchor_39" id="NOTEanchor_39"></a><a href="#NOTE_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>All the senses would offer me examples, in illustration
of this idea. Deprive the pleasures of physical love
of moral associations, which touch the heart, and you
take from it all that elevates the enjoyment above that
of the lowest animals. Else, why do modesty, innocence,
the expression of unstained chastity, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
graces of simplicity possess such enchanting attractions?
The truth, that there exists in love a charm stronger
than physical impulse, is not unknown even to women
of abandoned manners. The most dangerous of all those
in this unhappy class, are they, who, not relying on
their beauty, feign still to possess, or deeply to regret
those virtues, which they have really cast away.</p>

<p>There are useful duties upon this subject, which I
should find it difficult to present in our language. In
proportion as the manners of a people reach the extreme
refinement of artifice and corruption, their words become
chaste. It is a final and sterile homage rendered
to modesty.</p>

<p>The last delights which imagination can add to the
pleasures of love, are not to be sought in those vile places
where libertinism is an art. We must imagine the first
wedded days of a young and innocent pair, whose spirits
are blended in real affection, in similar tastes, pursuits
and hopes, who realize those vague images which they
had scarcely allowed before to float across their mind.</p>

<p>They who seek in the pleasures of taste only physical
sensations, degrade their minds and finish their useless
existence in infirmity and brutal degradation. The
pleasures of taste should only serve to render the other
enjoyments more vivid, the imagination more brilliant,
and the pursuits of life more easy and pleasant.&mdash;All
objects should present themselves under a gay aspect.
A happy veil should shroud those pains which
have been, or are to be endured. Even the wine cup,
more powerful than the waters of Lethe, should not
only procure forgetfulness of the past, but embellishment
of the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The pleasures derived from odors are only vivid, when
they impart to the mind a fleeting and vague exaltation.
If the orientals indulge a passion for respiring perfumes,
it is not solely to procure pleasurable physical sensations.
An embalmed atmosphere exalts the senses, and disposes
the mind to pleasant revery, and paints dreams of paradise
upon the indolent imagination.</p>

<p>Were I disposed to present the details of a system upon
this subject, the sense of hearing would offer me a
crowd of examples. The brilliant and varied accents
of the nightingale are ravishing. But what a difference
between hearing the melody from a cage, and listening to
the song at the noon of night, when a cool and pure air
refreshes the lassitude of the burning day, and we behold
objects by the light of the moon, and hear the strains of
the solitary bird poured from her free bower!</p>

<p>A symphony, the sounds of which only delight the ear,
would soon become wearying. If it have no other determinate
expression, it ought, at least, to inspire revery,
and produce an effect not unlike that of perfumes upon
the orientals.</p>

<p>Suppose we have been at an opera, got up with all
the luxury of art. Emotions of delight and astonishment
rapidly succeed each other, and we believe it impossible
to experience new sensations of pleasure. In returning
home, we chance to hear in the distance, through
the stillness of night, a well remembered song of our
infancy, that was sung to us by some one dear to
our memory. It is at once a music exciting more
profound emotion, than all the strains of art which we so
recently thought could not be surpassed. The remembrances
of infancy and home rush upon the spirit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
efface the pompous spectacle, and the artificial graces of
execution.<a name="NOTEanchor_39a" id="NOTEanchor_39a"></a><a href="#NOTE_39a" class="fnanchor">[39a]</a></p>

<p>Observations to the same effect might be multiplied
without end. If you desire pleasures, fertile in happy
remembrances, if you wish to preserve elevation of mind
and freshness of imagination, choose, among the pleasures
of the senses, only those which associate with moral
ideas. Feeble, when separated from the alliance of
those ideas, they become fatal when they exclude them.
To dare to taste them, is to sacrifice happiness to pleasures
which are alike ephemeral and degrading. It is to
resemble him, who should strip the tree of its flowers, to
enjoy their beauty. He loses the fruits which would
have followed, and scarcely casts his eye on the flowers
before they have faded.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PLEASURES OF THE HEART.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>The Creator has put forth in his gifts, a magnificence
which should impress our hearts. What variety in those
affectionate sentiments, of the delights of which our natures
are susceptible! Without going out of the family circle,
I enumerate filial piety, fraternal affection, friendship,
love, and parental tenderness. These different sentiments
can all coëxist in our hearts, and, so far from weakening
each other, each tends to give vigor and intensity to
the other. No doubt, the need of so many affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and props attests our feebleness and dependence. But I
can scarcely conceive of the happiness, which a being,
impassible to weaknesses and wants, could find in himself.
I am ready to bless that infirmity of our natures,
which is the source of such pure pleasures, and such
tender affections.</p>

<p>Let us avoid confounding that sensibility which exacts
the pleasures of the heart, with that which produces
impassioned characters. They differ as essentially
as the genial, vital warmth, from the burning of a
fever. Indolence, objects calculated strongly to strike
the imagination, and those maxims which corrupt the
understanding, develope a vague and ardent sensibility,
which sometimes conducts to crime, and always to misery.
The other species is approved by reason and preserved
by virtue. We owe to it those pure emotions
which impart upon earth an indistinct sentiment of the
joys of heaven.</p>

<p>There are men, however, who dread genuine sensibility;
and, under the conviction that it will multiply their
pains, study to eradicate the germs of it from their soul.</p>

<p>Hume was unhappily an unbeliever; but I might easily
cite from his life many honorable traits indicative of
a good natural disposition. He remarked to a friend,
who confided to him his secret sorrows, ‘you entertain
an internal enemy, who will always hinder you from being
happy. It is your sensibility of heart.’ ‘What!’
responded his friend with a kind of terror, ‘have you not
sensibility?’ ‘No. My reason alone speaks, and it declares
that it is right to soothe distress.’</p>

<p>In listening to this reply of Hume, we are at once
struck with the idea, that the greater part of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
adopt his principles, do not pause at the same point with
their model. They sink into that heartless class, who
see all human calamities with a dry eye, provided they
have no tendency to abridge their own enjoyments.</p>

<p>Suppose even that they pursue the lessons of the
Scotch philosopher to better purpose; and without any
emotion, without any impulse of heart, hold out a succoring
hand to those who suffer. This, perhaps, may
answer the claims of reason. But the social instinct will
always repel that austere morality, which would give to
the human heart an unnatural insensibility, and deprive it,
if I may so say, of its amiable weakness. I would hardly
desire to see a man oppose a courage, too stoical, to his
own miseries. The natural tears which he sheds in extreme
affliction, are his guaranty for the sympathy which
he will feel for my sorrows.</p>

<p>It is a vile but common maxim, that two conditions
are necessary to success in life. The one is, to have a
selfish heart. The other, the adage of egotism, is, that
to avoid suffering, we must stifle sensibility. I say to
these heartless philosophers of the world, that if the only
requisite is to avoid suffering, through destitution of feeling,
to die is the surest method of all.<a name="NOTEanchor_40" id="NOTEanchor_40"></a><a href="#NOTE_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The secret of happiness does not consist in avoiding
all evils; for in that case, we must learn to love nothing.
If there be a lot on earth worthy of envy, it is that of a
man, good and tender hearted, who beholds his own creation
in the happiness of all who surround him. Let
him who would be happy, strive to encircle himself with
happy beings. Let the happiness of his family be the
incessant object of his thoughts. Let him divine the sorrows
and anticipate the wishes of his friends. Let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
inspire the fidelity of affection in his domestics, by pledging
to them a comfortable and pleasant old age. Let
him, as far as may be, preserve the same servants, and
give them all needed succor and counsel. In fine, let
the inmates and dependents of the house all respire a
calm and regulated happiness. Let even the domestic
animals know, that humanity presides over their condition.</p>

<p>Entertaining such views, it will be easy to see in what
light I contemplate those men who take pleasure in witnessing
the combats of animals. What man who has a
heart, can see spectacles, equally barbarous and detestable,
with satisfaction; such as dogs tearing to pieces
a bull, exhausted with wounds, cocks mangling each
other, the encounter of brutal boxers, or of bad boys in
the streets, encouraged to the diabolical sport of fighting?
These are the true schools of cowardly and savage ferocity,
and not of manly courage, as too many have supposed.<a name="NOTEanchor_41" id="NOTEanchor_41"></a><a href="#NOTE_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
But it is not my purpose to draw a painting
in detail of the abominations of cruelty, or the pleasures
of beneficence, and I resume my rapid and desultory
reflections.</p>

<p>To preserve the sentiments of beneficence and sensibility,
let us avoid the pride which mars them. Beneficence
in one respect resembles love. Like that, it courts
concealment and the shade.</p>

<p>The most useful direction we can give to beneficence
is, to multiply its gifts as widely as possible. Let us
avoid imitating those men who are always fearful of being
deceived by those who solicit their pity. In an uncertainty
whether or not you ought to extend succor, grant it.
It can only expose you to the error that is least subject
to repentance.<a name="NOTEanchor_42" id="NOTEanchor_42"></a><a href="#NOTE_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Offer useful counsels and indulgent consolations. Save,
from despair, the unfortunate victim, who groans under
the remorse of an unpremeditated fault. Unite him
again to society by those cords which his imprudence
has broken. Rekindle in him the love of his kind, by
saying to him, ‘though you may not recover innocence,
repentance can at least restore your virtue.’</p>

<p>If we have access to the opulent and powerful, we
have an honorable, but difficult task to fulfil. To assume
the often thankless office of soliciting frequent favors for
friends, without losing the consideration necessary to success,
requires peculiar tact, discernment and dignity.&mdash;Above
all, it requires disinterested zeal. In attempting
this delicate duty in the form of letters, we may soon dissipate
our slender fund of credit. Letters of recommendation
resemble a paper currency. They are redeemed
in specie so long as they are issued discreetly, and in
small amounts, but which become worse than blank paper,
as soon as we multiply them too far.<a name="NOTEanchor_43" id="NOTEanchor_43"></a><a href="#NOTE_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Such is the intrinsic attraction of beneficence, that
even if we refuse to practise it, we still love whatever retraces
its image. A romance affects us. Pathetic
scenes soften our hearts at the theatre. In thus embracing
the shadow, we pay a sublime testimonial to the
substance.</p>

<p>The example of beneficence so readily finds its way
to every heart, that we are affected even in thinking of
those who practise it. The coldest hearts pay a tribute
of veneration to those women, who, in consecrating themselves
to the service of the poor and the sick, encounter
extreme fatigue, disgust, and often abuse from the wretched
objects themselves, in the squalidness and filth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
prisons and hospitals. How beautiful to learn to put
forth patience to mitigate the maladies of the body, and
hope, to soothe those of the mind!<a name="NOTEanchor_44" id="NOTEanchor_44"></a><a href="#NOTE_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Ye, who practise
virtues thus touching and sublime, may well hope the
highest recompenses of heaven. Such alone are worthy
of your pure spirits. Ye seem to have passed in light
across our dark sphere, only to fulfil a transient and celestial
mission, to return again to your country.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PLEASURES OF THE UNDERSTANDING.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>In the savage man the intellectual faculties sleep. As
soon as his appetites are satisfied, he sees neither pleasures
to desire, nor pains to fear. He lies down and
sleeps again. This negative happiness would bring
desolation to the heart of a civilized man. All his faculties
have commenced their development. He experiences
a new craving, which occupations, grave or futile,
but rapidly changed and renewed, can alone appease.
If there occur between them intervals which can be
filled neither by remembrances, nor by necessary repose,
lassitude and ennui intervene, and measure for him the
length of these chasms in life by sadness.</p>

<p>The next enemy to happiness, after vice, is ennui.
Some escape it without much seeming calculation. My
neighbor every morning turns over twenty gazettes,
the state articles of which are copied the one from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
other. Economising the pleasure of this reading, and
gravely reposing in the intervals, he communicates,
sometimes with an oracular tone, sometimes with a
modest reserve, his reflections to those who surround
him; and, at length, leaves the reading room with the
importance of one who feels that he has discharged a
debt to society.</p>

<p>In public places, it is not the spectacles, but the emotions
of the common people who behold them, that are
worthy of contemplation. In the murder of a poor tragedy
by poorer actors, what transports from this enthusiastic
mass of the audience when a blow of the poniard,
preceded by a pompous maxim, lays the tyrant of the
piece low! What earnest feeling, what sincere tears do
we witness! How much more worthy of envy these
honest people who lose their enjoyment neither by the
revolting improbability of the situations, nor by the absurdity
of the dialogue, nor by the mouthing of the rehearsal,
than those fastidious critics who exalt their intellectual
pride at the expense of these cheap enjoyments!</p>

<p>From the moment in which a man feels sincere
pleasure in cultivating his understanding, he may date
defiance to the fear of the weight of time. He has the
magic key which unlocks the exhaustless treasury of
enjoyments. He lives in the age and country which he
prefers. Space and time are no longer obstacles to his
happiness. He interrogates the wise and good of all
ages and all countries; and his conversations with them
cease, or change object, as soon as he chooses. How
much gratitude does he owe the author of nature for having
impressed on genius so many different impulses! With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Plato, he is among the sages of Greece, hearing their
lessons and associating his wishes with theirs for the
happiness of his kind.<a name="NOTEanchor_45" id="NOTEanchor_45"></a><a href="#NOTE_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In the range of history, he
ascends to the infancy of empires and time. Does he
court repose? Horace bids him gather the roses before
they fade; or Shakspeare reminds him, when illusions
will vanish like the baseless fabric of a vision.</p>

<p>If a man has powers and acquirements, it is a great
evil, if he is disposed to fatigue others with his self-love.
If we could number all the subjects of which the most
accomplished scholar is ignorant, we should perceive
that the interval between him and a common person
is not so immense as he may imagine. Ought he to
be astonished if the real friends of the Muses tire of his
declamations, his recitations and occupancy with himself?</p>

<p>To attain truth should be the real end of all study.
In such researches the mind kindles, as by enchantment,
at every step! The desire to succeed, produces that
noble emotion which is always developed by ardent zeal
and pure intentions. Success, although we were to
think nothing of its results, inspires a kind of pleasure;
because truth comports with our understanding, as brilliant
and soft colors agree with the eye, or pleasant
sounds with the ear. This enjoyment naturally associates
with another still more vivid. The effect of truth
is universally salutary; and every instance in which our
feeble intellect discovers some gleams, elevates the
spirit, and intimately penetrates it with a high degree of
happiness.</p>

<p>One of the chief advantages of study is, that it enfranchises
the mind from those prejudices that disturb
life. How many, and what agonizing torments have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
been caused by those which are associated with false
ideas of religion.<a name="NOTEanchor_46" id="NOTEanchor_46"></a><a href="#NOTE_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> After those great calamities in the
dark ages which destroyed the traces of the sciences
and arts, men, pursued by terror, seemed to imagine
that they constantly saw malevolent spirits flying among
the clouds or wandering in the depth of woods. The
sound of strong wind and thunder came to their ear as the
voice of infernal divinities; and, prostrate with terror,
they sought to appease their angry gods by bloody sacrifices.
In process of time, a small number of men, enlightened
by observation, dared to raise the veil by
degrees, and succeeded in dissipating these terrors by
tracing the seeming prodigies to some of the simplest
laws of physics. The phantoms of superstition vanished,
and, in the light of reason, revealed a just and beneficent
Divinity presiding over obedient nature.</p>

<p>We think, in our pride, that an immense interval
separates us from those times of disaster, ignorance and
alarm. How many of our kind, unhappy by their intellectual
weakness, still tremble before the jealous and
implacable god of their imaginations, who enjoins hatred
and wrath; and punishes even the errors of opinion by
the most horrible torments. The man who is exempt
from prejudices is alone capable of prostrating himself
before the Divinity from a feeling of love, and whose
prayer, alike confident and resigned, is addressed to his
noble attributes of power, justice and clemency.</p>

<p>There are other errors which study dispels. The
student who is charmed with communion with the muses,
does not consume his best years in gloomy intrigues;
nor do you meet him pressing forward in the path which
ambition has traced. The Greeks, fertile in significant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
allegories, supposed the same divinity to preside over
the sciences and wisdom.</p>

<p>The habit of living in converse with the noblest works
of mind and art, produces elevation of soul; and he who
has an elevated mind must be intrinsically good and
happy. Exempt from the weaknesses of vanity, free
from the tumultuous passions, he cultivates the noble and
generous virtues for the pleasure of practising them.
Disdaining a mass of objects of desire which disturb the
vulgar, he offers a small mark to misery. Should adversity
strike him, he has resources so much the more
sure, as he finds them in himself.</p>

<p>No one can ever taste the full charm of letters and
the arts, except in the bosom of retirement. If he reads
and meditates only for the pursuit of fame, amusements
change to labors. If we propose to enter the lists, outstrip
rivals, and direct a party, we are soon agitated with
little passions, but great inquietudes. Heaven, sternly
decreeing that no earthly felicity shall be unalloyed,
has placed a thirst for celebrity as a drawback upon the
love of study.</p>

<p>But ought the ardor to render immortal services&mdash;ought
the noble ambition to be useful, to be stifled?
Are not these the source of pleasures as pure as they
are ravishing? I contemplate an immense and indestructible
republic, composed of all those men who devote
themselves to the happiness of their kind. Occupied
without relaxation or abatement in continuing the
works which their predecessors have begun, they bequeath
to their successors the care of pursuing and
crowning their labors. Men of genius are the chiefs of
this republic. As they have talents which separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
them from the rest of the human race; they have also
pleasures reserved for themselves alone. What a sublime
sentiment must have elevated the spirit of Newton
when a part of the mysterious laws of the universe first
dawned on his mind! A glow still more delightful
must have pervaded the bosom of Fenelon when meditating
the most beautiful lessons which wisdom ever announced
to the powerful and the rulers of the people.
To these privileged beings it belongs, to give a powerful
impulse to minds, and to trace a new path for the
generations to come.</p>

<p>I shall have attained my humble ambition if, docile to
the voice of the wise, I shall be able, in any degree, to
indicate the way in which these lessons may be put in
practice. I shall thus have contributed my aid to dissipate
the night of prejudice and vice.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PLEASURES OF THE IMAGINATION.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>If these words denote pleasures which have no reality,
let us no longer use them.<a name="NOTEanchor_47" id="NOTEanchor_47"></a><a href="#NOTE_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The person who, during
the twelve hours of every day that he passed in sleep,
believed himself clothed with royal authority, shared a
lot exactly similar to the king who, dreaming through
the same number of hours, imagined that he suffered
cold and hunger, and asked the pity of the peasants in
the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>All our pleasures are fugitive, and they are all real.
That wonderful faculty, the imagination, awakens past
pleasures, charms the instant that is flowing, and either
veils the future, or embellishes it in the radiance of hope.</p>

<p>Let us banish that vulgar prejudice which represents
reason and imagination as two enemies which cannot
coëxist. The severest reason ought to disdain no easy
and pure pleasures. The happy paintings even of a
dream bring joy, until their rainbow hues melt away.
The dreams of the imagination have greatly the advantage
over those of sleep. Our will gives them birth.
We prolong, dissipate and renew them at pleasure.<a name="NOTEanchor_48" id="NOTEanchor_48"></a><a href="#NOTE_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
All, who have learned to multiply these happy moments,
know, at the same time, how to enjoy these agreeable
visions, and paint with enchantment those dreamy hours
which they owe to the effervescence of a gay imagination.</p>

<p>There are situations in which reason has no better
counsel to give us than to yield ourselves up to those
illusions which mingle pleasures with our sufferings.
I knew a worthy, but unfortunate man, who passed
twenty months in prison. He informed me that, every
night, he had a dream, in which he imagined that his
wife and children visited him and restored him to
liberty. This dream left a remembrance so profound,
an emotion so delightful, that he determined to attempt
to renew it by day. When evening came, exciting his
imagination to its most vigorous action, he endeavored
to persuade himself that the moment of the reunion was
come. He represented to himself the transport of his
wife and the caresses of his children; and he allowed
no thought but these delightful visions to occupy his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mind until the moment when sleep once more wrapped
him in forgetfulness. The habit of concentrating his
imagination for this result, he assured me, finally rendered
these illusions incredibly vivid and real. He expected
night with impatience; and the certainty that the
close of day would bring some happy moments, threw
over the tedious hours an emotion which mitigated his
sufferings.</p>

<p>These charming illusions, in misfortune, resemble
those brilliant boreal lights which, in the midst of a
night that lasts for weeks, present the image of dawn
during the dreary winters of the polar circle. An excitable
and vivid faculty, which deceives misfortune,
ought to embellish happiness. To the pleasant things
we possess, it adds those we desire. By its magic, we
renew the hours of which the memory is dear. We
taste the pleasures which a distant future promises;
and see, at least, the fleeting shadow of those which are
passing away.</p>

<p>A gloomy philosopher has told us, that such illusions
are the effect of a transient insanity. It seems to me
that insane thoughts are those which create ennui; and
that reasonable ideas are those which throw innocent
charms over life. If you reject these views, be persuaded,
at least, not to adopt a false and gloomy wisdom.
You ought rather to prefer the conviction that everything
below is folly.<a name="NOTEanchor_50" id="NOTEanchor_50"></a><a href="#NOTE_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But still, I can distinguish gay
follies, frightful follies, and amiable follies; and I easily
discover that there is a choice among them.</p>

<p>Why should the morose being who perceives only
bad people on the earth, and only miseries in the future,
blame him who cradles flattering hopes, always springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
up anew, for allowing himself to be beguiled by the
illusions of his imagination? Both deceive themselves.
But the one cherishes a mistake which brings hatred
and suffering, and the other lives on gaily in his illusions.</p>

<p>Wisdom does not disdain a faculty merely for being
brilliant; and, to taste all the pleasures of imagination,
it is indispensable that reason should be much exercised.</p>

<p>Imagination resembles the magician of an oriental
romance who transports his favorite hero to scenes of
enchantment, to try him with pleasures; and then delivers
him over to a hostile magician, who multiplies peril
and misery around him. This creative faculty, in its
perversion, is as fertile to invent torments as, in its more
propitious moods, to bring forth pleasures. If once we
resign ourselves to its gloomy caprices, it conjures up
the terror of a thousand unreal evils. Reason cannot
always follow its meteor path; but ought, at least, to
point out the course in which happiness invites it to
walk.</p>

<p>The aid of reason is still more necessary at the moment
when the chimeras of imagination disappear. It
is an afflicting moment. Reason should prepare us to
meet it. Every man, with an elevated mind and a good
heart, has delighted to imagine himself far away from
the stupid and wicked; in a smiling country, separated
from the rest of the world, and alone with a few friends.
Suppose this dream realized; I am aware that, tomorrow,
the peaceful exile might be indulging regrets for the
place he had left; and forming plans to escape from the
ennui of the new country. Since we change our destiny
in these respects, without altering our instinctive
desire of change, let us study the art of softening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
pains of our actual condition; and let us learn to extract
all possible advantages from it by imparting to it, if
nothing more, the embellishment created by the happy
anticipations of a fertile imagination.</p>

<p>Ought we to indulge regrets because these paintings
of the imagination so rapidly disappear. I have seen
the rich and the great stripped, in a moment, of their
fortune and power; and shall I afflict myself because
my dream has vanished? These unfortunate people
lost all that was dear to them, forever. For me, I can
renew these pleasures of imagination at my will.</p>

<p>Far from sacrificing any of our faculties, let us exercise
them all; and let them mutually conduce to our
happiness. As we advance in life, our reason should
grow to the calm of mature age. But let the imagination
and the heart still preserve scintillations of the fire
of youth.</p>

<span class="fs70">MELANCHOLY.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>There is no pleasure of earth but, as soon as it becomes
vivid, has a tendency to tinge itself with melancholy.
The birth of an infant, the convalescence of a
father, the return of a friend who has been long absent,
fill the eyes with tears. Nature has thus chosen to
mingle the colors of joy and sadness. Having destined
us to experience each of the emotions in turn, she has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
ordained that the shades of transition should melt into
each other.<a name="NOTEanchor_51" id="NOTEanchor_51"></a><a href="#NOTE_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The dearest remembrances are those which are accompanied
by tenderness of heart. The sports of
infancy, the first loves, the perils we have forever
escaped, and the faults we have learned to repair, are
of the number. Whoever will recollect the happiest
moments of his life, will find them to have produced this
emotion.</p>

<p>But there are two kinds of melancholy; or rather,
we must not confound melancholy with gloom. Will
the slight tenderness of sorrow which imparts a new
charm to the fugitive pleasures of existence be inspired
by those gloomy books which this age has attempted to
bring into fashion; by those terrific and wild dreams in
which hideous personages enact revolting scenes?
Modern imagination has painted melancholy a tall and
unearthly spectre enveloped in a winding sheet. The
real traits of her countenance are those of innocence
occupied in pleasant revery; and at the same time that
tears are in her eyes, a smile dwells on her lips.</p>

<p>It is the resort of a sterile imagination and a cold
heart, to invest even the tomb with borrowed ideas of
darkness; to wait for night in which to visit it; and to
torment the fancy to people it with sinister phantoms.
Real sensibility would not require such an effort to be
awakened. It fills my mind with a pleasing sadness to
wander in the church-yard, under the melancholy radiance
of the moon, among monuments of white marble,
and hear the night breeze sigh among the weeping willows.
I am deeply affected with, here and there, a
touching inscription.<a name="NOTEanchor_52" id="NOTEanchor_52"></a><a href="#NOTE_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I remember one in which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
father says, that he has had five children, and that here
sleeps the last that remained to him for consolation. In
another, a father and mother announce that their daughter
died at seventeen, a victim of their weak indulgence,
and of the extravagant modes of the time. This sojourn
of repose, these words written in the abodes of silence,
which inspire tenderness for those that are no more, and
those whose treasured affection still remembers them,
always penetrate the soul with an emotion not without
its charms. In the view of tombs, we immediately direct
our thoughts to an internal survey of ourselves. I
mark out my place among the peaceful mansions. I
imagine the vernal grass and flowers reviving over my
place of rest. My imagination transports me to the
days which I shall not see, and sounds for me the soothing
dirge of the adieus of friendship pronounced over
the spot where I am laid.<a name="NOTEanchor_53" id="NOTEanchor_53"></a><a href="#NOTE_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>I generally carry from my sojourn in these our last
mansions, one painful sentiment. I remark that many
tombs are raised by parents for their children; by husbands
for their wives; by widows for their husbands.
I observe that there are but few erected by children for
their fathers. Perhaps it is right that love should ascend
in that scale, rather than descend in the other.</p>

<p>Occasional visits to ruins and tombs inspire salutary
melancholy. But the habit of frequently contemplating
these lugubrious objects is dangerous. It blunts sensibility
and creates the necessity of always requiring
strong emotions. It nourishes in the soul sombre ideas
which do not associate with happiness. Without doubt,
there are those who are so unhappy as to long for the
repose of the grave; who find solace in these gloomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
spectacles. Young, after having lost his only daughter,
after having in vain solicited a little consecrated earth
to cover the remains of the youthful victim; after being
reduced to the necessity of interring the loved one with
his own hands, might be tempted to fly his kind and
love only night, solitude and tombs. There have been
men, condemned by the award of nature, to such reverses
as nourish an incurable and perpetual melancholy.
Their frigid imitators, without their reason and profound
feeling, in wishing to render themselves singular, become
tiresome and ridiculous in their melancholy.</p>

<p>Writers of the most splendid genius of the age have
consecrated their talents to celebrate melancholy;
not that melancholy which has a smile of profound
sensibility, but that which has been cradled in tombs
and which holds out to us the full draught of sadness.
There is something in these heart-rending scenes, these
lugubrious spectacles, which the age seeks with avidity.
A writer whose talent tends to render his errors seducing,
has taken pleasure in viewing the christian religion
as opening an inexhaustible source of melancholy. It
seems to exalt his mind, most of all, when it presents
itself to him under a funereal aspect.</p>

<p>He paints religion as born in the forests of Horeb
and Sinai, forever surrounded with a formidable gloom;
and offering to our adorations a God who died for men.
He describes the invasion of the barbarians, the persecutions
of the first believers, cloisters arising from deep
and dark groves, and melancholy continually receiving
new accessions from the austere rules imposed upon the
pious inmates.</p>

<p>‘There,’ said he, ‘the tenants of these religious seclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
dug their own tombs, by the light of the moon, in
the cemeteries of their own cloisters. Their couch was
a coffin. Some of them occasionally wandered away
to sojourn among the ruins of Memphis and Babylon,
striking the chords of the harp of David, surrounded by
beasts of prey. Some condemned themselves to perpetual
silence. Others sung a continual hymn, echoing
the sighs of Job, the lamentations of Jeremiah, or the
penitential songs of the prophet king. Their monasteries
were built on sites the most savage, on the summits
of Lebanon, in the deep forests of Gaul, or on the crags
of the British shores. How sad the knell of the religious
bells, heard at the noon of night, must have
sounded when calling the vestals to their vigils and
prayers! The sounds, as they swelled and died away,
mingled the last strains of the hymns with the distant
dashing of the waves. How profound must have been
the meditations of the solitary who, from his grated window,
indulged in revery, as his eye wandered over the
illimitable sea, perhaps agitated with a tempest! What
a contrast between the fury of the waves and the calm
of his retreat! The expiring cries of men are heard as
they dash upon the rocks at the foot of the asylum of
peace. Infinity stretches out on one side of their cell;
and on the other the slab of a tomb alone separates between
eternity and life. All the different forms of misfortune,
remembrance, manners, and the scenes of nature
concurred to render the christian religion the genius
of melancholy.’<a name="NOTEanchor_53a" id="NOTEanchor_53a"></a><a href="#NOTE_53a" class="fnanchor">[53a]</a></p>

<p>Can it be thought, for a moment, possible that sighs
without end, the love of deserts and the hope of the
tomb are all the consolations that this divine religion is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
calculated to bring to the heart of man? Such an error
could only have had its origin in an unregulated imagination.
The christian religion, though pensive and serious,
is not sad. Less brilliant, less imaginative than
paganism, less friendly to pleasure, she is far more
favorable to happiness.</p>

<p>My opinion in regard to the legitimate tendency of
religion, is not only different but directly opposite. A
pure religion must produce tranquillity, confidence and
joy. It is departure from religious views which are
true and just, that is followed by a vague sadness, gloom
and despondency.</p>

<p>These funereal and yet eloquent paintings, traced
with the enthusiasm of melancholy, must have had the
effect to increase the number of men of atrabilious temperament,
weary of the world, and tired of themselves.
Were it true that the christian religion inspired an
insatiate craving for funereal reveries, far from considering
it as I do, divine, I should estimate it anti-social.&mdash;The
true friends of the christian religion always paint it as
it is, more powerful than even human misery; giving
clothing to the naked, bread to the hungry, an asylum to
the sick, a peaceful home to the returning prodigal, and
a mother to the orphan; wiping away the tears of innocence
with a celestial hand, and filling the eyes of the
culpable and contrite with tears of consolation. Let
pious thankfulness and a calm courage, which even death
cannot shake, environ its modest heroes. Let its martyrs
be those of charity and toleration;&mdash;the protestant
opening an asylum to catholic, falling under the fanatical
fury of his brethren; and when bloody and impious
mandates order the massacre of protestants, the catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sheltering them in his mansion. Such was the spirit of
Erasmus; such, of the divine Fenelon; such, of William
Penn, and a few tolerant lights that have gleamed through
ages of persecution and darkness. Such are the men
whose disciples we desire to multiply. Let us cease to
incorporate melancholy errors and gloomy follies with the
religion of peace, confidence and hope. Eloquence was
imparted for a nobler use.</p>

<span class="fs70">RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>The philosophy of happiness must find its ultimate
requisite in the hopes of religion. Man must be persuaded
that his present life has relation to a never ending
future, and that an eternal providence watches over
the universe, before he will abandon himself with a tranquil
confidence to those irresistible laws by which he is
borne along. He then marches towards the future, as
he would confidently follow a guide of tried prudence
and fidelity in a dark path.<a name="NOTEanchor_54" id="NOTEanchor_54"></a><a href="#NOTE_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>In the fever and tumult of worldly pleasures and pursuits,
the voice of wisdom has little chance to be heard,
and it seems necessary that misfortune should have forced
the mind in upon itself, before we become inclined to
find resources in religion. Then we invoke this sublime
and consoling power, and like the friend that avoids our
prosperity and our festivals, but returns to cheer our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
misfortunes, this celestial friend is at hand to offer her
sustaining succor. We may class all those pleasures as
noxious, which will not associate with this august visitant.
Even in our periods of happiness, if we pause for the reflection
of a moment, we find the need of immortality.
All the generous and tender affections acquire a new
charm in alliance with religious ideas, in the same manner
as objects beautiful in themselves, receive a new lustre
when a pure light is thrown upon them. Filial piety
becomes more touching in those children who pray with
fervor for the preservation of the life of a mother. Let
a pious courage guide the sister of charity, and she becomes
the angel of consolation, as she visits the abodes
of misery. Even virtue itself does not receive its celestial
impress, except in alliance with religious sentiments.
A few of the higher philosophers among the great ancients,
and Fenelon, Newton, Milton and a few other
men of immortal name, saw the divinity as He is, and
contemplated the perfect model of his infinite perfections.
Their efforts tended to coöperate with the divine views
of order and harmony, in constantly directing human actions
and thoughts towards good. The beautiful system
of the gospel has the same simplicity of object; and its
tendency to honor and meliorate humanity is directed
by the highest wisdom. Sentiments which give to all
our faculties a direction, fertilize genius as well as virtue.
High models, in any walk of mind, will never be produced
in a world whose inhabitants believe in nothing
but matter, fortuitous combinations, and the annihilation
of our being. Apostles of atheism! your dreary creed
throws an impenetrable gloom upon the universe, and
dries the source of all high thoughts. The advocates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
these views vaunt the necessity of proclaiming the truth.
I, too, am the fearless advocate of the truth, and have
no dread of its results. But could I be persuaded, that
religious hopes were unfounded, I should be tempted
to renounce my confidence in truth itself; and no longer
to inculcate the necessity of loving and seeking to propagate
it. It is by the light of this divine torch, that real
sages have desired to investigate religion. Were it possible
that the elevated and consoling ideas, which religion
offers, could be baseless and absurd chimeras, error
and truth would be so confounded, that there would no
longer remain any discriminating sign by which to distinguish
the one from the other. Atheists boast that they
are the only frank and hardy antagonists of superstition.
They are its most effectual allies. The superstitious
have brought forth the atheists, and the atheists have
re-produced the superstitious; as, in revolutions, resistance
produces fury, and that multiplies resistance.</p>

<p>I have known excellent men, apparently earnest and
docile inquirers for truth, who have desired in vain to
establish in their mind these consoling convictions.&mdash;Their
understanding refused to respond to the wish of
their hearts.</p>

<p>Why can I not impart this happy conviction to their
understanding? My subject precludes reasoning, and I
only know arguments that are very simple; but I think
with Bacon, that it needs quite as much credulity to
adopt the opinion of atheists, as to yield faith to all the
reveries of the Talmud or the Koran. The more profoundly
I attempt to investigate the doctrines of infidelity,
and consider everything that surrounds me, as resulting
from the combinations of chance, the play of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
atoms, the efforts of brute matter, the more my inquiries
are involved in darkness. I strive in vain to give
to any hypothesis of atheism the honest semblance of probability.
Matter cannot reflect upon the order which
its different parts require. Neither can those parts interchange
reason and discussion. Neither an atom, nor a
globe can say to others of their class, ‘such are the courses
in which we must move.’ Let us simplify difficulties, as
much as possible, and admit that matter has always existed;
let us even suppose motion essential to it; a supreme
intelligence is none the less necessary to the harmony
of the universe. Without a governor of worlds,
I can only conceive of nihility or chaos.</p>

<p>From the sublimest of all thoughts, there is a God,
flow all the truths which my heart desires. The beautiful
superstructure of Christianity results, as a corollary,
or ultimate inference, from this consoling axiom.
The system which rejects the soul’s immortality, is
equally absurd with that of atheism. Of the different
arguments against the being of a God, the most striking
one is that which is drawn from the evils which prevail
on the earth. The first thought of every man of sensibility,
is, that had he the power to make a world, he
would banish misery from it, and so arrange the order
of things, as that existence should be, to all conscious beings,
a succession of moments, each marked by happiness.
But infirmities, vices, misery, sorrow and death pursue
us. How reconcile the misery of the creation with
the power and beneficence of the Creator? How resolve
this strange problem? How explain this revolting
contradiction? Immortality is the only solution of the
enigma of life.<a name="NOTEanchor_55" id="NOTEanchor_55"></a><a href="#NOTE_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>A whimsical combination of deism and materialism
forms, at present, the most widely diffused system among
the unbelieving. They have imagined a God possessing
only physical power, and contemplating the movement
of his innumerable worlds, alike indifferent to crime
and virtue. He beholds with the same carelessness the
generations that pass, and those that succeed; and sees
deliverers and tyrants alike confounded in their fall.&mdash;Admit
the truth of such dogmas, and the conceptions of
a religious man would possess more expansion and sublimity
than the views of the Eternal. Socrates, without
the illumination of the gospel, could have taught them
better. Surrounded by his weeping disciples, he points
them beyond the tomb to the places where the sage at
last respires freely; and where the misfortunes and inequalities
of earth are redressed. In painting these illusions
of hope, if they are vain, the sage has conceived in
his dreams an equity superior to that of the infinite Being.
Let us dare to maintain that the feeble children of
clay have a right to entertain ideas of order and desert,
more just than those of the Creator, or admit that the
heart, made capable of the desire of another life, is destined
to enjoy it.</p>

<p>The destiny of all the inferior orders that surround
us, appears to terminate upon the earth. Ours alone is
evidently not accomplished here. The animals, exempt
from vice, incapable of virtue, experience, in ceasing to
live, neither hopes nor regrets. They die without the
foresight of death. Man, in the course of an agitated
life, degrades himself by follies and vices, or honors himself
by generous and useful actions. Remembrances,
loves, ties, in countless forms, twine about his heart. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
is torn, in agony, from beings for whom he has commenced
an affection that he feels might be eternal. Persecuted
for his virtue, proscribed for his wisdom and courage,
calumniated for his most conscientious acts, he turns
to heaven a fixed look of confidence and hope. Has
he nothing to perform beyond death? Has the author
of nature forgotten his justice, only in completing his
most perfect work?</p>

<p>Our immortality is a necessary consequence of the
existence of God. Let us not wander astray in vain
discussions, which, with our present faculties, we can
never master&mdash;such as relate to the nature of the soul.
My hopes, my convictions, rest not upon a cloudy, metaphysical
argument. Neither can the proud treatise
of a sophist weaken, nor the puerile dialectics of a pedant
increase it. It is enough for me that there is a
God. Virtue in misfortune must have hopes which do
not terminate with the tomb. The sublime inculcation
of Socrates was, ‘preserve confidence in death.’ But
recompense in another existence supposes merit; and
merit requires liberty.</p>

<p>Is man free? We can reduce this question which has
been so much vexed, and so often obscured, to terms of
entire simplicity. It has been most forcibly presented
by Hobbes, the vile apostle at once of atheism and despotism,
who seems to have striven to unite the most pernicious
doctrines with an example, which merits execration.
‘Two objects,’ he remarks, ‘attract us in opposite
directions. As long as they produce impressions nearly
equal, our mind, in a state of uncertainty, vacillates
from the one to the other; and we believe, that we are
deliberating. Finally, one of the objects strikes us with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a stronger impression than the other. We are drawn towards
it; and we believe that it is because we will it.&mdash;Thus,
man, always passive, yields to the strongest and
most vivid sensation. Free actions would be an effect
without a cause.’ Admirable reasoning! What other
freedom could I wish, than to prefer what seems to me
the most desirable? Let the disciples of Hobbes instruct
me how they would choose that man should determine,
in order to be conscious of liberty? Would
they wish him to choose the object that is repugnant to
him? This is too evidently absurd. Should he vacillate
in indifference between the one object and the other?
This would be to sink into an existence of perfect apathy,
without reason or will. Man has all the liberty, of
which such a being is capable&mdash;all, in fact, which he
could desire.</p>

<p>How puerile are these metaphysical subtleties, when
employed upon moral truths!<a name="NOTEanchor_56" id="NOTEanchor_56"></a><a href="#NOTE_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> What a monster would
man become on the system of the fatalists! What is
that system worth, the consequences of which cannot be
admitted? If we act under the inevitable empire of fatalism,
why is he who proclaims this doctrine, indignant
at the thought of crime? Does he contemplate Socrates
and his executioners with the same approbation?&mdash;Will
he regard with the same feeling Antoninus dictating
pious lessons to his son, and Nero assassinating his
mother? Will he estimate as alike meritorious a persecuted
Christian praying for his enemies, and the monarch
ordering the massacre of St Bartholomew? Do such
contrasts offend us? And why? According to the system
of fatalism, the good ought to inspire us with less interest
than the wicked. A blind fatality awards to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
virtuous that pure pleasure, that is inseparably connected
with good actions. They receive a high reward
without any merit; while the others are a prey to remorse,
and the incessant object of public hatred and abhorrence.
If they are innocent, as on the principles of
fatalism they must be, how ought we to mourn over them,
and pity them! What purpose can these doctrines
serve? He who advocates them, is conscious of impulses
to do good, and deliberates upon alternatives in the
courses which honor and duty call him to pursue. His
principles, then, are contradicted by the voice of his
own heart. When he has committed a fault, it declares
to him that he might have chosen a contrary part.&mdash;When
he has done a virtuous action, it inspires emotions
of joy, which render him conscious that he is a free agent.
This voice within is anterior to all reasoning, and as incapable
of being invalidated as any other consciousness.
Inexhaustible emotions of satisfaction spring from religious
hopes. Reanimated by them, I no longer see
tears without consolation, nor fear an eternal adieu.&mdash;The
tomb, though a fearful, is but a frail barrier, which
separates us from those real joys, of which the pleasures
of a fugitive existence are but the shadow.</p>

<p>Never would men have exchanged their natural convictions,
their internal aspirations, their instinctive hopes
of immortality, for the lurid and deceptive glare of infidelity,
if religious views had not been disfigured by
being combined with the grossest errors and prejudices.
Of these, there are two which every good man ought to
strive to eradicate from all minds, and if it were possible,
to purge from the earth.</p>

<p>The first causes us to behold in the divinity a menacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and implacable judge, constantly eager to execute
vengeance. Monstrous conception! Revolting error!
Infancy and old age, the two extremes of earthly existence,
which from their feebleness, call for our most
soothing cares, are those most persecuted with this vile
and fierce prejudice. A cruel superstition has selected
these terrific ideas, these horrible images, with which to
besiege the bed of death, to light up the scene of agony&mdash;of
parting and trembling apprehensions&mdash;with the flames
of perdition. My bosom swells with mingled emotions,
when I see any one attempting to darken the feeble and
docile reason of a child with these sinister views. Pursued
even in his dreams by these terrible menaces, before
he knows the meaning of crime, he has already felt
its torments. Astonishing infatuation! It is in this aspect
that gloomy religionists have presented the compassionate
and sustaining hope of the gospel. Instead of
inspiring sweet and consoling ideas, they have succeeded
in filling innocence with remorse.</p>

<p>The other prejudice is intolerance, or that spirit which
causes us to view all persons guilty, whose faith is different
from ours. While religion enjoins it upon us to
cover the faults of our kind with a veil of indulgence, intolerance
teaches us to transform their opinions into
crimes. Religion rears asylums for the unfortunate.&mdash;Intolerance
prepares scaffolds for all whom she chooses
to denominate heretics. The one invokes ministers of
charity, and the other, executioners. The one wipes
away tears, and the other sheds blood.</p>

<p>Intolerance without power is simply ridiculous; but
becomes most odious when armed with authority. The
cry of humanity is ‘Peace with all men.’ If any were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
excepted, it should be the intolerant. Even they merit
no severer punishment, than the inflictions of their own
fury. They may attain to deliverance from remorse in
their confident delirium, and may count their crimes as
virtues, through the influence of self-blindness. But this
strange obliquity of the understanding, this horrible intoxication,
repels happiness. Joy and peace must fly
the soul, of which this spirit has taken possession.</p>

<p>In another life, the measure of our felicity in the mansions
of the just, will be the happiness we have created
for the beings around us in this fleeting existence. A
religious man constantly strives to render this, our terrestrial
sojourn, more like the abode towards which his
thoughts are elevated. His constant occupation is to
mitigate suffering, banish prejudice and hatred, and calm
the fury of party. All his relations are those of peace
and love. Intolerant men! Who, of your number, will
hope to hear it said of him in the retribution of the just,
‘much has been forgiven him, because he has loved much?’</p>

<span class="fs70">OF THE RAPIDITY OF LIFE.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>In considering the different ages of life, the first sentiment
I feel, is gratitude for the variety of pleasures, destined
for us by nature. Thrice happy for us, if we knew
how to taste the charms of all the situations through
which we pass! Instead of this, we first regret infancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
then youth, then mature age. The happy period is always
that which is no more.</p>

<p>It is a great folly to sadden the present, in looking
back upon the past, as though it had been darkened by
no shadow of a cloud. The sorrows which nature sends
us in infancy, resemble spring showers, the traces of
which are effaced by a passing breeze. The pains and
alarms of each age have been chiefly the work of men.
Who cannot remember the violent palpitations which
he felt, when, exposed to the searching eye of his companions,
he went forward to excuse his not having prepared
his task, his translation or theme, at school? I
have seen situations more perilous, since that time, but
no misfortunes have awakened more bitterness, than the
preference granted by the professor to the theme of
another over mine. The beautiful age, for a frivolous
being, is youth; for the ambitious, maturity; for the
recluse, old age; for a reasonable man, each age: for
heaven has reserved peculiar pleasures for each.</p>

<p>The second sentiment I experience, in contemplating
life, is, regret to see the moments so rapidly gliding away.
Time flies, and days and years steal away as rapidly as
hours. Still, some complain of the burden of time, and
endure cruel suffering from not knowing how to employ
it.</p>

<p>To prolong my days, I will neither ask the elixir of
life from alchymists, nor precepts from physicians. A
severe regimen tends to abridge life. Multiplied privations
give a sadness to the spirit, more noxious than the
prescribed remedies are salutary. Besides, what is
physical without moral life; that is to say, improvement
and enjoyment? Physicians vaunt the miracles of abstinence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and a careful regimen in the case of Cornaro,
the Venetian, who was born dying, and yet spun out the
thread of life with so much care that he vegetated a
century. To attain this result, he weighed his aliment,
and marked every hour of the day, with the most minute
exactness. Bacon cites the case, but jests upon a
man who believed himself living, because, in fact, he
was not dead.</p>

<p>Moderation, cheerfulness and the happy employment
of time furnish the best means of living as many days as
nature permits; and the regimen of philosophic moralists
has an effect more certain than that of physicians.<a name="NOTEanchor_57" id="NOTEanchor_57"></a><a href="#NOTE_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Every one has observed that a year in youth presents
a long perspective; and that the further we advance in
our career, the more the course of time seems to accelerate.
Let us strive to investigate the causes which so
modify our judgments, with a view, if it be possible, to
avoid them.</p>

<p>There is one inevitable cause&mdash;experience. At sixteen,
what an illimitable prospective space is seen in the
sixteen years that are to succeed! The termination of
the latter period is lost to vision in the future, as the
commencement of the first years are effaced from the
memory of the past. But, in touching the goal which
seemed so distant, we have discovered a scale by which
the mind’s eye measures the future. Impatient youth,
burning to overleap the interval which separates the object
from the desires, strives to accelerate the tardy
hours. In mature age, on the contrary, seeing every
day bringing us nearer the termination of our career, we
begin to regret the want of power to arrest the march of
time. Thus our weakness hastens the flight which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
desire to delay. Let us be less fearful of the uncertain
future, and the hours will lose their desolating swiftness.</p>

<p>Finally, in our youth, all objects being new, produce
the vivid impression of novelty. Every instant is filled
with landmarks of memory, because in every instant a
new sensation is produced, and a new link in the chain
of the succession of ideas. As we advance in time,
objects imperceptibly cease to excite our curiosity. We
pass by beautiful objects and striking events which once
filled us with transport or surprise, with a carelessness
which fails to fix them in our memory. We return
mechanically to the occupations of the preceding day,
scarcely noting the transit of those monotonous periods
which were rendered remarkable neither by ennui nor
pleasure. Let us avoid this mental carelessness, which
gives new speed to the flight of time, and is so fatal to
happiness. Friends of humanity, of literature, of the
arts and true enjoyment, let us preserve the mind in
its freshness, the imagination in its youthful brilliancy.
Let us thus arrest the happy moments; and let us preserve
the enthusiasm of youth enlightened by the taste
of mature age, for everything which merits our admiration.<a name="NOTEanchor_58" id="NOTEanchor_58"></a><a href="#NOTE_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>If we desire that our days should not be abridged, we
must love retreat. The immediate result of this shelter
is to keep off a crowd of officious and indolent people.
There are those who would not think of taking our money,
and who yet will steal hours and days from us without
scruple. They seem not to realize the value of these
fractions of time which are the material of life.</p>

<p>But while the idle rob us of hours, we ourselves sacrifice
years. A great portion of our race, deafened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the clamor of the passions, agitated by feverish dreams,
are scarcely conscious of existence; and, awakening
for a moment, at death, regret that they have been long
on the earth and yet have not lived. A few others,
after having been long swept onward by the torrent,
taught at last by experience, resist, land and fix their
sojourn far from the tumult; and, finally, begin to taste
the pleasant consciousness of existence. Why not prolong
these final hours to the utmost? If our pursuits
interdict us from the independent command of our time,
we may, at least, consecrate portions of every evening
to retreat, in order to review the past, pause on the present,
and prepare for the future. Thus, making every
day count in accumulating the pleasant stores of memory,
we add it to the happy days of the past, and no longer
allow life to vanish like a dream.</p>

<p>It is, more than all, in converse with ourselves that
we give a right direction to the mind, elevation to the
soul, and gentleness and firmness to the character. Life
is a book in which we every day read a page. We
ought to note down every instructive incident that
passes.</p>

<p>The admirable Marcus Aurelius took delight in converse
with himself; and learned to find enjoyment in
the present by extracting from the past lessons for the
future. I never fail to be affected when I read the
account which he gives of all those persons whose cares
had concurred to form his character and his manners.
‘I learned,’ says he, ‘of my grandfather Verus, to be
gentle and complaisant.</p>

<p>‘The reputation which my father left, and the memory
of his good actions which has been preserved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
taught me modesty. My mother formed me to piety,
taught me to be liberal, and not even to meditate, still
less, to do a wrong.</p>

<p>‘I owe it to my governor that I am patient of labor,
indulge few wants, know how to work with my own
hands, meddle with no business that does not concern
me, and give no encouragement to informers.</p>

<p>‘Diognetus taught me not to be amused with frivolities,
to yield no credit to charlatans and enchanters, and
to have no faith in conjurations, demons and superstitions
of that sort. I learned of him to permit every one
to speak to me with entire freedom, and to apply myself
wholly to philosophy.</p>

<p>‘Rusticus made me perceive that I needed to correct
my manners, that I ought to avoid the pride of the
sophists, and not use effort to inspire the people with
admiration of my patience and austerity of life; to be
always ready to pardon those who had offended me,
and to receive them kindly whenever they were disposed
to resume their former intercourse.</p>

<p>‘I learned of Apollonius to be at the same time
frank and firm in my designs, to follow no guide but my
reason, even in the smallest matters, and to be always
composed, even under the most acute sufferings. By
his example I was instructed that it is possible to be at
once severe and gentle.</p>

<p>‘Sextus taught me to govern my house as a good
father, to preserve a simple gravity without affectation,
to attempt to divine and anticipate the wishes and necessities
of my friends; to endure, with calmness and patience,
the ignorant and presumptuous who speak without
thinking what they say; and to sustain relations of
kindness with all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I learned from Alexander, the grammarian, in disputation
to use no injurious words in reply to my antagonist.</p>

<p>‘Fronto taught me to know that kings are surrounded
by the envious, by knaves and hypocrites.</p>

<p>‘Alexander, the Platonist, instructed me never to say
or to write to any person interceding for my interest,
“I have had no time to attend to your affairs;” nor to
allege, as an excuse, “I have been overwhelmed with
business;” but to be always prompt to render all those
good offices which the bonds of society demand.</p>

<p>‘I owe to my brother Severus, the love which I have
for truth and justice. From him I derived the desire to
govern my states by equal laws, and to reign in such a
manner as that my subjects might possess perfect liberty.</p>

<p>‘I thank the Divinity for having given me virtuous
ancestors, a good father, a good mother, a good sister,
good preceptors and good friends; in a word, all the
good things I could have desired.’<a name="NOTEanchor_59" id="NOTEanchor_59"></a><a href="#NOTE_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>A crowd of useful thoughts cannot but flow from such
self-converse. Hold every day one of these solitary
conversations with yourself. This is the way in which
to attain the highest relish of existence; and, if I may
so say, to cast anchor in the river of life.</p>

<span class="fs70">ON DEATH.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>If we were to allow ourselves to express the wish
that we might never die, an absurd wish which, perhaps,
every man has sometimes indulged, a moralist might say,
‘Suppose it were granted, where would be the end of
dissension, hatred, revenge? Where would the victim
whom injustice pursues, find an asylum and repose?’
To all this it is sufficient to reply, that if we accuse
nature for having subjected us to the penalty of death,
we have not less reason to accuse her for having often
rendered death desirable, as a relief from greater evils.
Instead of showing herself so niggardly in bestowing
happy moments, why did she not spare humanity the
evils that render death a comparative release?</p>

<p>There are, as I believe, more solid reasons to justify
nature in rendering death an inevitable allotment. When,
undertaking to reform the universe in my day dreams,
I render our earthly existence eternal, I find no difficulty
in imagining all the evils which afflict us removed.
But I strain my imagination to no purpose to give form
and reality to those pleasures which shall be adequate
to replace those which this new order of things cannot
admit. Suppose that it were no longer necessary that
generation should succeed generation; and that death
were banished from the earth. The same beings,
without hopes or fears, would always cover its surface.
No more loves; no more parental tenderness; no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
filial piety! Flattering hopes forsake the bosom along
with enchanting remembrances. All those affections
which give value to life owe their existence to death.<a name="NOTEanchor_60" id="NOTEanchor_60"></a><a href="#NOTE_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Our prejudices transform death into a terrible spectre,
accompanied by frightful dreams. The dark and anti-social
doctrine, that we were placed on the earth for
the punishment of exile, and that we ought never to
intermit our contemplation of the grave, was imagined
by hypocrites, who preached to others contempt of the
world, that they might appropriate it to themselves. A
wise man sees in existence a gift which he ought not to
sacrifice. In learning how to live, he instructs himself
how to die.</p>

<p>We must sometimes look Death in the face to judge
how we shall be able to sustain his approach.<a name="NOTEanchor_61" id="NOTEanchor_61"></a><a href="#NOTE_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It is
not necessary often to repeat this stern examination
which presents gloomy ideas, even to minds the most
disciplined. Another manner of contemplating the final
scene offers all the useful results of the first, and presents
nothing afflicting. It consists in observing the influence
which death ought to exercise over life. This term,
unknown, but always near, should render our duties
more sacred, our affections more tender, our pleasures
more vivid. In noting the rapidity of the flight of time,
a wise man seizes upon those ideas which disturb the
hours of the multitude, to enhance the charm of his own
thoughts. It was not without an aim that certain of the
ancient philosophers placed in their festal hall a death’s
head decked with roses.</p>

<p>Those who say that death is nothing, may be thought
to affect the semblance of courage. They speak, in
fact, only one of the simplest truths. The term death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
is the sign of a purely negative idea; and denotes an
instant impossible for thought to measure. It is not yet
death, or it is past; and there is no interval.</p>

<p>Without doubt, the circumstances which precede it
are extremely afflicting. Sudden deaths ought to cost
us fewer tears than any others. Yet we hear it repeated,
with a sigh, ‘the unfortunate sufferer lingered but a few
hours.’ Was not that space sufficiently long when the
moments were counted by agony? Let us not tinge our
views by the coloring of egotism; and we shall perceive
in this prompt departure, two motives for consolation;
that the deceased, whom we regret, saw not the long
approach of death in advance; and, that, in meeting it,
he experienced a brief pang. Such an end is worthy
of envy, and is the last benefit of heaven.</p>

<p>So died my father, the best of fathers, whom every
one recognised by his force of character, his gentleness
and serenity. He did not dazzle, either by his vivacity of
mind, or the variety of his acquirements. But he so said
the simplest things as to render them the best. During
sixty-five years he shared the pains of others, but never
added to them. One day, having experienced unaccustomed
fatigue, he retired early, and a few moments
after, slept in death. Such a death, without pain and
alarm, was worthy of a life so pure that, to render him
happy in the life to come, it would be only necessary to
leave him the remembrance of what he had been and
what he had done upon earth.</p>

<p>A fact recognised by numberless observing physicians
is, that the last agony of a good man is rarely violent.
It is probable, that in regard to all forms of death, mankind
generally entertain the most erroneous conceptions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
The vulgar, naturally embracing ideas that terrify them,
believe that the dissolution of our earthly being is accompanied
by all conceivable torments. It is probable,
on the contrary, that, in entering upon eternal repose,
we experience sensations analogous to those of a wearied
man who feels the sweet influence of sleep stealing
gently upon him.</p>

<p>These sensations, it is true, can be imagined to belong
only to the last moments. Cruel maladies may precede
them. But it would seem that nature invariably employs
some means to mitigate the evils which she inflicts.
Among mortal diseases, those which are severely painful
are equally rapid; while those which are slow in
their progress are comparatively free from pain. They
allow the patient time to accustom himself to the idea
of his departure. It is common for those who die in
this way to close their career in the indulgence of dreamy
and melancholy musings, solacing themselves alternately
by resignation and hope.</p>

<p>A spectacle, touching to the heart, and, unhappily, too
common, is presented in the case of a fair and florid
young woman struck with a pulmonary malady. Absolute
unconsciousness of danger often accompanies this
cruel disease to the last moment. We are perfectly
aware that the patient cannot survive the coming winter.
We hear her pantingly discuss the projects which she
expects to execute with her companions when health
and spring shall return. The contrast of her daily increasing
debility with her gentle gayety, and of her future
projects, with the rapid approach of death, makes the
heart bleed. Every one is pained for her but herself.
The hectic fever imparts a kind of joyous inspiration;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and nature, to absolve itself for inflicting death on one
so young, leads her to her last hour in tranquil security.
Death is to her as a sleep.</p>

<p>It is certain that physical sufferings are not those
which infuse the utmost bitterness into this last cup.
The gloomy thoughts with which death is invested are
excited much more keenly by those affections which
attach us to earth and our kind. We may well hold the
understanding of those ambitious persons in disdain who
instruct us, that when they have finished their vast projects
their days shall thenceforward glide in peace and
serenity. Death uniformly surprises them, tormenting
themselves in the pursuit of their shadows. Others,
with less show of stupidity, repine because death strikes
them reposing upon their pleasures. Their groans are
caused by having forgotten the rapidity and evanescence
of their joys. They had not known how to give them
an additional charm in saying, ‘we possess them but for
a day.’</p>

<p>But suppose we regret neither ambitious projects nor
transient pleasures, may we not wish to live longer for
our children? I attempt not to inculcate an impracticable
or exaggerated system. There is a situation in
which death is fearful. There is a period in which it
would seem as if man ought not to die. It commences
when one has become a parent, and terminates when
his sustaining hand is no longer indispensable to his
family.</p>

<p>If nature calls us to quit life before this epoch, all consolations
resemble the remedies which palliate the pains
of the dying, without possessing efficacy to remove them.
Still we dare not so outrage nature as to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
there can exist a situation in which a good man can find
no alleviation for his sorrows. In quitting a life which
he would wish to retain longer, for the happiness of
those most dear to him, he may derive force and magnanimity
from the thought that he owes it to himself to
leave an example of courage and decent dignity in the
last act; that he may show the influence of piety, resignation,
the hope of a good man, and the discipline of
that philosophy which forbids its disciple to struggle
against the inevitable lot.</p>

<p>The approach of death always brings associations of
gloom when it comes in advance of old age, to destroy
the tender affections. In the slow and natural course
of years, it is an event as simple, as little to be deprecated,
as the other occurrences of life. Alas! during a
short sojourn, we see those who were most dear continually
falling around us. We soon retain a less number
with us than exist already in another world. The
family is divided. I am not surprised that it becomes a
matter of indifference to a wise man to remain with his
present friends, or go and rejoin those that are absent.</p>

<p>As long as our children have need of our support,
we resemble a traveller charged with business of extreme
importance. As soon as these cares become
useless, we resemble him who travels at leisure and by
chance; and who takes up his lodging for the night
wherever the setting sun surprises him. For me, I see
the second epoch drawing near. If I reach it, I shall
bless heaven for having awarded me a sufficient number
of years, and for having diffused over them so few
pains.</p>

<p>Let us not charge that man with weakness who, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
on the eve of departure for distant and untravelled
countries, is perceived to impart the intonation and tenderness
of sorrow to his adieus. Ought we to exact
more of him whom death is about to conduct to that
‘undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller
returns?’ I would not seem to affect an austere and
unnatural courage. But whenever delivered from the
only heart-rending agony, I will hope and strive to preserve
sufficient tranquillity of mind to impress the sentiment
on those I love, that we ought, with becoming dignity,
to submit ourselves to the immutable laws of nature;
that complaint is useless, and murmuring unjust; and
that it becomes us, with transient but subdued emotion,
to say, as we receive the final embrace, ‘may we meet
again!’</p>

<span class="fs70">CONCLUSION OF ‘DROZ SUR L’ART D’ETRE HEUREUX.’</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>I shall have attained my purpose if these sketches
should produce any degree of conviction that man, in
exercising his faculties, can mitigate his pains and multiply
his pleasures, and, consequently, should serve as the outlines
of a plan for reducing the pursuit of happiness to an
art. I am aware that no view could be offered more
contrary to the prevalent opinions in society. The morose
and the frivolous make common cause to attack it. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
them the very idea seems absurd; and the most indulgent
among them question the good faith of him who
announces it.<a name="NOTEanchor_62" id="NOTEanchor_62"></a><a href="#NOTE_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>To such grave and learned authorities, and more,
even to the general suffrage against it, I might dare to
oppose counterbalancing authorities. From Socrates to
Franklin, I see philosophers who have been persuaded
that man may be directed in the art, and instructed in
the science of happiness; and that his faculties may be
enlarged to pursue it. Who are the men that have entertained
this persuasion? The very <em>elite</em> of the human race.
Was each individual of them surrounded by those happy
circumstances which would naturally inspire the same
philosophy? They were persons who had experienced
all the conditions of life. As if nature had studied to
prove, by great examples, that our happiness depends
upon our reason more than upon our circumstances, Epictetus
lived in chains, and Marcus Aurelius on a throne.</p>

<p>We justly render homage to the Greek philosophers.
Is their glory founded on their physics, long since known
to be full of errors, or their metaphysics, often puerile?
Upon neither; but they have merited the veneration of
ages by indicating principles, the practice of which,
would render us better and more happy.</p>

<p>Which of the sciences did the admirable Socrates
chiefly esteem? The single one which teaches us how
to live as we ought. Let it not be said that I substitute
one science for another; and that Socrates taught
morals, and not my pretended science of happiness.
With the Greeks, morals had a perfectly definite end.
Their philosophers held all their teaching subservient to
conducting their disciples to happiness. Illustrious men!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
we disdain their maxims, but still revere their names.
What fruit have we obtained from the boasted light and
improvement of the age? We speak with enthusiasm
of those sciences which they judged frivolous; and we
treat as chimerical those studies which they judged
alone worthy of human nature.</p>

<p>Suppose it had been said to these philosophers, ‘you
will never reform the human race; and, instead of
profitless dreams about wisdom and happiness, you
ought to desist from subjects so futile, and consecrate
your vigils to sciences more worthy to occupy your
thoughts.’ Would they not have smiled with pity upon
such counsel? Had they deigned to reply, would they
not have said, ‘We are well aware that we shall not
purify the heart of the wicked of its pride, envy,
cupidity; but shall we derive no glory from having
confirmed some good men in their career? In the
midst of storms we felt our energies invigorated as we
perceived that our spirits were in accordance with theirs.
However feeble may have been the influence of our
writings, affront not humanity by supposing that ours,
however partial may have been their circulation, will,
nowhere, find minds worthy to profit by them. Perhaps
they will kindle the holy love of virtue in some of
those who may read them in the youthful age of unsophisticated
and generous resolutions. Few, who read,
will practise our doctrine in all its extent. Almost every
one will be indebted to it for some solitary principles.
It is possible we may never have numerous disciples.
But we shall have some in all countries and in all time.
It is a truth that ought to satisfy us, that such discussions
are based neither upon exaggeration nor revery. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
science of happiness would indeed be chimerical if we
expected that it would impart the same charms to all
predicaments in which our lot might cast us. Instead
of indulging such visionary hopes, if these discussions
dissipate the errors which veil the true good from our
eyes, if we learn to bring together all the easy and innocent
pleasures, and to render the painful moments of
life more rapid, we have been taught an art which it is
possible to demonstrate and improve to an indefinite
extent.’</p>

<p>Does this art appear difficult? Let any one be
named which it exacts no effort to acquire. Will it be
thought that it cannot become of general utility? Will
professors, of the highest reputation, cease to teach eloquence
because they do not form as many orators as
they have pupils? The more maturely I have reflected
upon the art in question, the more clearly I am convinced
that it may be assimilated to the other arts. It
differs from them only in its superior importance. The
interest and attention that all the rest merit should be
measured only by their relation, more or less direct, to
this first of all arts. To settle the utility of any science,
law, enterprise, or action, I know no better measure
than to note its influence on human happiness.</p>

<p>If moral lessons leave but a transient influence, it may
be attributed to two principal causes; the weakness of
our nature, and the contagion of example. A third belongs
to those who teach us the doctrine of morals, and
is found in their exaggeration of their doctrine. They
elevate the altar of wisdom upon steep mountains; and
discourage our first steps, by proclaiming the painful efforts
necessary to scale them. From the sadness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
ministers of the worship, it would not be inferred, that
the divinity of the place was liberal in dispensing pure
pleasures, bright hopes, oblivion of pain, and remembrances
almost as pleasant as either.</p>

<p>It is a fatal error to imagine that it is useful to exaggerate
the doctrine of morals. To do this, fails not to
excite disgust towards the precepts inculcated. Men,
that have been deceived upon these points, as soon as
they judge for themselves, in their impatience to shake
off the yoke of prejudices, are tempted to reject principles
the most wise with those errors by which they have
been misled. That we may be heard and followed, let
us be true. Let us present, with force, the evils which
the abuse of our faculties brings upon our short career.&mdash;Let
us avow with equal frankness, that we commit an
egregious mistake, if we refuse, or neglect to draw from
our faculties all the advantages in our power, to embellish
life.</p>

<p>The doctrine of morals is a phrase that has been often
employed to designate the propagation of false and extravagant
principles. For this phrase, which is too worn
out, and of equivocal import, suppose we substitute a definition,
which will clearly indicate the end, towards
which, morals ought to be directed. Morals is that which
teaches the art of happiness. If it be not so, the foundation
of ethics is a mere matter of convention, either
useless or dangerous.</p>

<p>Morals should be taught only as subservient to happiness.
Austerity should be banished equally from the
manner of teaching and from the matter that is taught.&mdash;They
are the useful teachers, whose tenderness of heart
impels them rather to inspire virtue than to enjoin it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
whose brilliant imagination enables them to offer wise
principles under such pleasant forms as charm the mind
and awaken curiosity. If I were to point to one of
the best works on morals, according to my judgment, I
would name ‘<cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite>.’ To present a
family struggling with every form of misfortune, and constantly
opposing resignation or courage to each, is to
offer the sublimest painting that it is possible to execute.
The concurrence of genius and virtue could alone have
conceived the idea. All good men owe the tribute of
gratitude and veneration to the memory of the author.</p>

<p>The concurrent influence of public institutions and education
would be necessary to render the general habits
conformable to happiness. Books, the influence of
which I certainly have not exaggerated, may be useful
to men, raised by the discipline of their reason above
the multitude. That man is happy, who knows how to
add good books to the number of his friends, who often
retires from the world to enjoy their peaceful and instructive
conversation, and always brings back serenity,
courage and hope.</p>

<p>Were the doctrine true, that it is impossible to increase
the happiness or diminish the evils of life, it is not perceived
that it would not still be necessary to follow my
principles. Preach this discouraging doctrine to a good
man, and you may afflict him, but will obtain no influence
over his conduct. He will always strive to improve
his condition, mitigate the sufferings that press upon
him, and render men more compassionate and happy.
Such noble efforts cannot be entirely lost. The pure intentions,
the sincere wishes, which he forms for the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of his kind, give to his mind a pleasant serenity. It assures
his own happiness to meditate the means of increasing
that of others.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE CHOICE OF A PROFESSION.</span></h2>
    </div>

<p>The considerate Knight of La Mancha would not dismiss
his follower and friend to the government of Barataria,
without a few more last words, and without arming
him for his high functions with a copious homily of counsels
and admonitions. Before I leave you to the stern
encounter of the painful emergencies of life, to unravel its
intricacies, and settle its innumerable perplexing and difficult
alternatives, I do not mean to oppress your memory
with the thousand and one particular directions,
to meet every imaginable occurrence with the right mode
of conduct. Innumerable cases of perplexity will be continually
occurring, that can only be settled by extempore
judgment and prudence. I shall limit my counsels to a
single one among the many questions of universal application,
each one of which present a great variety of aspects
and alternatives; questions of difficult solution for the
young; and yet on the right disposal of which depend their
character, success and happiness in life. Among the subjects
to which I refer, are, the choice of a profession&mdash;decision
in regard to our plans and projects&mdash;the selection
of our company&mdash;the dispositions with which we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
regard the place assigned us in society&mdash;the deportment
appropriate to gentlemen and ladies&mdash;the proper selection
of books&mdash;the mode and place of worship, and
what are the best evidences of true wisdom in character.
The first of these is the only one upon which I shall offer
you my remarks.</p>

<p>In the choice of a profession, the first point to be consulted
is our physical and mental temperament and
endowment, or aptitude. That some are constituted
for sedentary and inactive pursuits, others to beat
the anvil, follow the plough, or mount the reeling
mast with a firm step in the uproar of a tempest; some
for the bar, others for the pulpit, and still others to be
musicians, painters, poets or engineers, I consider a
truth so universally and obviously taught by observation
and experience, that I shall not deem it necessary to
pause to prove it to such as would contest it. I am sufficiently
informed that there are those who contend that
all minds are formed equal and alike&mdash;and that all the
after differences result from education and circumstances.
With them, Virgil and Byron had no constitutional aptitudes
to poetry, and the same training that gave Handel
and Gluck their preëminence in music, would have imparted
to any other mind equal skill. According to their
system, La Place and Zerah Colburn were no earlier or
more strongly inclined to mathematics, than other children.
These sapient physiologists in descending to the
animal tribes, ought to find, that web-footed animals had
no natural aptitude for water, the canine tribes for animal
food, and the ruminating, to feed on grass and vegetables.
I shall leave those who hold this dogma to retain
it unquestioned so far as I am concerned; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
will be obliged to leave me to mine, which is, that there
are immense differences in the physical and mental constitution,
differences which every enlightened parent discovers
in his children from the very dawn of their faculties&mdash;differences
which every intelligent instructer notes
in his pupils, as soon as he becomes intimately acquainted
with them&mdash;differences which, to keen and close observation,
distinguish more or less each individual in the
immense mass of society. No matter how much alike
these persons are reared and trained; the most striking
diversities of endowment are often observed in members
of the same family, reared and educated with all possible
uniformity. This is, no doubt, a beautiful trait of that
general impress of variety, which providence has marked
upon every portion of the animate and inanimate creation.
Nature has willed, that not only men should possess
an untiring diversity of form, countenance and mind,
but that not two pebbles on the shore, or insects in the
air, should be found precisely alike. The sign manual
of the Creator on his works is a grand and infinite variety.</p>

<p>The physiological inquiry whence these differences
of temperament and aptitude arise, is one, which belongs
to another subject; though I have no wish to conceal my
belief, that the fundamental positions of phrenology are
as immovably founded in fact, and as certainly follow
from observation, as the leading axioms of any physical
science. It is enough for my present purpose, that the
order of every form of society calls for an infinite variety
of aptitude, talent and vocation, and that nature has furnished
the requisite variety of endowment, adequately to
meet those calls.</p>

<p>The ancient system, still in use, goes on the supposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that all minds are originally alike; and that all children
are equally fit to be trained for each of the vocations.
Hence we see tailors at the anvil, and blacksmiths on
the shopboard, innumerable excellent ploughmen generating
prose, and sleeping at the bar and pulpit, and ingenious
fiddlers ruined as engineers; in a word, all that ludicrous
disarrangement and seeming play at cross purposes, in
virtue of which, men, who would have been borne, by a
strong current, to the first place in the profession for
which nature designed them, become dull and useless in
another. A great part of the whole labor of instruction
has thus been worse than thrown away. It has been the
hard effort of poetic fiction, laboring the huge stone up
an acclivity, to see it recoil and hear it thunder back
again; the effort to circumvent, and cross the purposes of
nature.</p>

<p>It seems to me to be among the most responsible inquiries
of a parent and a conscientious instructor, what
pursuit or calling is indicated for his child by his temperament
and aptitude? The boy, who, like Pope, even in
childhood lisps in numbers, because the numbers come,
will probably be found to have not only an ear for the
peculiar harmony of rhythm, but an inventive mind, stored
with images, and a quick eye to catch the various phases
of nature and society. If placed under favorable circumstances,
and judicious training, this child will become
a poet, while ninety-nine in a hundred of those, who
make verses, could by no forcing of nature ever rise
higher than rhymers. Thus may be detected the embryo
germs of temperament, endowment and character,
which give the undeveloped promise of the future orator,
lawyer, mathematician, naturalist, mechanician, in a word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of the mind fitted to attain distinction in any walk in society.
I am aware of the mistakes, which fond and doting
parents are likely to make, in interpreting an equivocal,
perhaps an accidental sally of the cherished child,
to be a sure proof of genius and endowment. No judicious
and intelligent parent will be in much danger of being
led astray by fondness so weak and misguided.&mdash;Wherever
real endowment exists, it never fails to put
forth continual indications. It is the elastic vigor of nature
working at the root, to which no foolish partiality
will be blind.</p>

<p>It is true, that nature, equally beneficent in what she
has granted, and what she has withheld, forms the million
for the common duties and undistinguished employments;
stamps them at once with a characteristic uniformity
and variety; and sends them forth with specific
adaptations, but not so strongly marked, as not to be mistaken
with comparative impunity. Hence the ordinary
pursuits and employments of life are conducted with general
success, notwithstanding these smaller mistakes in
regard to endowment.</p>

<p>Not so in those rarer instances, where she has seen fit
to stamp the clear and strong impress of peculiar endowment
and aptitude, in which the embryo poet, painter,
mathematician, naturalist, and orator are indicated by
such unequivocal signs, as cannot easily be overlooked,
or mistaken by any competent judge. Hence, in the
biography of most of those who have truly and greatly
distinguished themselves, we are informed that the most
ordinary people about them were perfectly aware of the
harbingers of their future greatness. I am confident,
that to keen and faithful observation these harbingers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
as palpable in the germ, as in the development. To
mistake in such a case, and not only to withdraw the
youthful aspirant from the career to which nature beckons
him, but to force him into one, in which every effort
must be rowing against the stream, is to consign him
to an Egyptian bondage, a slavery of the soul, by
which many a spirit of firmer mould has been broken
down, and lost to society, and others worse than lost,
rendered the scourge and curse of all with whom their
lot was cast.</p>

<p>Such as have arrived at a maturity of reason and
years, to have the responsibility of the choice of a profession
cast upon themselves, will infer, what are my
views in regard to the first element, by which they
ought to be directed. It involves a previous question,
for what pursuit or calling their temperament, faculties
and powers best fit them? By long and close observation,
pursued with a fidelity proportioned to its importance,
by intent study of themselves, as called out by
the changes of their health and prospects, the fluctuations
of their spirits, their collisions with society, in all
the contingencies that befall them, they can scarcely fail
to form some conception of the peculiar cast of their
powers, and the walk in life, for which their capabilities
are best adapted. If they select wisely in this respect,
habit and time will certainly render it the profession of
their inclinations.</p>

<p>As soon as the mind begins to survey the professions,
in regard to the honors, emolument and success, which
they respectively offer, there is great danger, lest imagination,
taking the place of reason, should look at the scene
through a prism, and see all the chances of an illusive brilliancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of promise, which sober experience will be sure to
disappoint. There are the immense promises of the
law, alluring a crowd of aspirants and competitors, the
greater portion of whom must fail to realize their expectations.
There are the honors of the physician, binding
him, by the strongest of all ties, to the confidence and affection
of the families that employ him. He exercises
the only profession that does not depend upon the caprice
of fashion, or the vibrations of transient feeling.&mdash;There
is the ministry, with its time-honored claims, its peculiar
title to be admitted to the privacy of affection, sickness
and death, and its paramount capability of the highest
forms of that only eloquence that swells and softens
the heart, by coming home to men’s business and bosoms.
There is the varied range, and the rapidly acquired fortunes
of merchandize and commerce; the growing interest
and importance of the new portico to a new order of
nobility, manufactures. There is agriculture, always
seen to be the most satisfactory and useful of employments,
and now rapidly coming to be viewed in the light
of scientific investigation and of a liberal pursuit. To adjust
and settle the respective views, which the judgment
and imagination will take of the chances of these various
pursuits, and their contiguity to love, marriage, wealth,
and distinction, will be found to be no easy task. Sometimes
one view will predominate&mdash;sometimes another;
and the mind appears like a pendulum vibrating between
them.</p>

<p>Reason presents one decisive view of the subject. All
these chances&mdash;all these balances of advantage and disadvantage
have long since settled to their actual and
natural level. If the law presents more tempting baits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and more rich and glittering prizes, over-crowded competition,
heart-wearing scramble, difficulty of rising
above the common level, into the sun and air of distinction,
are appended, as inevitable weights, in the opposing
scale. The advantages and disadvantages of all the professions
are adjusted by the level of society, exactly in
the same way. He who is guided in this inquiry by
common sense, will comprehend at a glance, that it is impossible,
in the nature of things, to combine all the advantages
and evade all the disadvantages of any one pursuit.
No expectation more irrational and disappointing can be
indulged, than to unite incompatible circumstances of
happiness. The inquirer must reflect, that such a pursuit
connects a series of fortunate chances; but there
are the counterbalancing evils. Such another has a different
series of both. It is folly to expect to form an
amalgam of these immiscible elements. Reason can expect
no more than that we unite in the calling, finally fixed
upon, as many fortunate circumstances as possible, and
avoid, as far as may be, its inconveniences and evils.</p>

<p>The history of circumstances under which I commenced
reading the book of M. Droz, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur l’ art d’ étre heureux</cite>, the
substance of the first chapter of which is given as above, will
not be irrelevant, I would hope, <em>to you</em>, if to others. It was
a beautiful April morning, and I had wandered away from the
town, with the book in my hand, among the hills. I inhaled
a bland atmosphere that just ruffled half formed leaves, and
shook from trees, shrubs and flowers the pearly drops and the
delicious aroma of the season. A dun, purple, smoky vapor
veiled the brilliancy of the sun and gave the face of nature
its most exquisite coloring. A repose, like sleep, seemed to
rest upon the earth, only interrupted by the ruminating of
the flocks and herds on the hill sides. The bees sped away
to their nectar cells from tree and flower, leaving upon the
dark and fleeting line of their passage through the air a
lulling hum like the tones of an Eolian harp. A large town,
with its ceaseless and heavy roll of mingled sounds, lay outstretched
beneath my feet. Painted boats were slowly wending
their way along a canal from the town, and winding their
course round the foot of the hills. Before me was a vast
panorama of activity, business, commerce and all the accompaniments
of a busy town. A few paces behind me, and I
was plunged in a forest where town and commerce and life
were hidden as if by the shifting of a scene, and the jay
screamed, and the woods showed as to the red man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
seen them centuries before. A beautiful spring branch murmured
by me in its deep and flood-worn channel down the
glen. A little advance spread the town before me. A little
retreat gave me back to the wildness of nature in the forest.
Here I had often enjoyed much of the little that life allows
us to enjoy, in quiet communion with nature and my own
thoughts. I had never experienced it in higher measures
than at this moment. Could I, by a volition, have arrested
the flight of time and the succession of sensations, here
would I have fixed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">punctum stans</i> of existence, and been
content to have this scene always around me, and the enjoyment
of this union of meditation and repose, perpetual.</p>

<p>But a change came over my thoughts, as I read the quaint
axiom, laid down with such mathematical precision, <em>man is
formed to be happy</em>. What I saw and what I felt, my own
consciousness assented to the proposition. But, startled by
a transient feeling of pain, a new train of ideas succeeded. I
have only to pass, said I, the short interval between this repose,
verdure, quietness and internal satisfaction, to reach the scene
of dust and smoke before me. Besides spires and mansions,
I shall see hovels, poor, blind, lame, squalid, blaspheming
youth, imbecile age, prostitutes, beggars, haunts of felons
and outlaws; and even in the abodes of what shows external
comfort and opulence, the sick and dying hanging in agonies
of suspense upon the countenance of their physician and
friends, as they catch gleams of hope or shades of despair
from their aspect. Many of these sick, even if they recover,
will only be restored to trembling age, to perpetual and incurable
infirmity, and to evils worse than death. Yet, unhappy
in living, and afraid to die, they cling to this wretched existence
as though it were the highest boon. These varied
shades of misery that the picture before me will present to
the slightest inspection, in ten thousand forms and combinations,
are visible in every part of our world. I, too, shall soon
add to the deepness of the shading. My friends will depart
in succession; and in my turn, on the bed of death, I shall
look in the faces of those most dear to me, as I am compelled
to depart out of life. What an affecting contrast with what
I see and what I am!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Why there is this partial evil in the world is not a question
which I shall here attempt to vex; for I could add nothing to
what has already been said upon the subject. It is enough
that the evil does actually exist. Is it remediless? Can life be
so spent as to leave a balance of enjoyment set over against
the evil? These are my questions. There will always be inequality,
ignorance, vice, disease, a measureless amount of misery
and death. What portion of the evils of life can be cured?
What portion must be manfully, piously endured? What transient
gleams of joy can be made to illumine the depth of shade?</p>

<p>I yield entire faith to the doctrine before you, that, estimate
these evils as highly as you may, a balance of enjoyment may
still be struck in favor of life. I do not doubt, that more than
one half the suffering and sorrow which every individual endures
is simply of his own procuring, and not only that it might
have been wholly avoided, but that positive enjoyment might
have been substituted in its place. An inconceivable mass
of misery would at once be struck from the sum if, as I have
already remarked, we knew the physical, organic and moral
laws of our being, and conformed ourselves to them. A uniform,
consistent and thorough education would cure us of innumerable
errors of opinion, injurious habits, and a servile conformity
to established and prescribed prejudices, and would impart
to us wisdom, force of character and resignation, to enable
us to sustain, as we ought, those that are unavoidable. Imperfection,
pain, decay and death, in the inevitable measures belonging
to organized beings, would remain. The dignity of
true philosophy, the stern consciousness of the necessity of
courage, profound and filial submission to the divine will,
and the well defined and investigated hopes of religion would
accomplish the remainder.</p>

<p>Consider one single evil&mdash;fear, unnecessary fear, an entirely
gratuitous infusion of bitterness in the cup of life. I ask the
man who has seen fourscore winters to tell me, were all that
he has suffered in his pilgrimage cast into one account,
what would be the greatest item in the sum? I believe that
almost every one might answer, that more than half might be
charged to one single source of suffering&mdash;fear&mdash;fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
opinion, reproach, shame, poverty, pain, danger, disease and
death. I pause not to consider the usual dull illustrations of
the wisdom and utility of assigning to us the instinct of fear,
to put us on our guard and to enable us to ward off evils. It
is not this instinctive shrinking and vigilance to avoid evil
that I consider. Let education have its most perfect work in
raising us superior to this servile and tormenting passion,
and too much of it would still remain. Of all that we have
suffered from fear, what portion has been of any service in
shielding us from that which we apprehended? Not only
have we avoided no evil in consequence, but the enervating
indulgence of this passion has taken from us our quickness of
foresight, our coolness of deliberation, our firmness of action
and resolve, by the exercise of which, we might have escaped
all that we dreaded. We may calculate then, that every
pang we have felt from this source has been just so much
gratuitous agony.</p>

<p>Not only natural instincts, but acquired habits are transmitted;
and this evil of fearfulness, this foreboding of apprehension,
shaping the fashion of uncertain ills, has been
the growing inheritance of countless generations; and a
shrinking and effeminate timidity has been woven into our
mental constitution by nature. Education, instead of resisting,
or counteracting, or diminishing the transmitted mischief,
has labored with terrible effect, to make it a principle and a
motive to action, and the most efficient engine of the inculcated
systems of morality and religion. Fear of death, and a
slavish terror, springing from misapprehensions of the character
of the divine being, and unmanly and debilitating horrors in
regard to the unknown future in another life, these have been
the chief sources of this evil. Terribly have the father and
the mother, the minister and the school-master, and general prescription
and example concurred, to strengthen this barbarous
instrument of governing, which never inspired a good action,
and which it would be cruel to apply to a slave. Horrible
have been the bondage, the mean abjectness of spirit, the
long agony of the soul, which this inculcation has inspired.&mdash;We
have been sedulously trained in a course of discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
which has made us afraid of our own shadows in the dark, and
inspired us with shrinking and terror in view of a silent and
peaceful corpse, which, in the eye of sober reason, should
originate associations no more fearful, than a waxen figure.
We, who are the victims of this inborn and instinctive inheritance,
we, who have had it inwoven by precept, education and
example, and the prevalent impression, that it is one of the
purest and most religious motives of action, are best able
from our own consciousness, and the memory of what we
have suffered from it, to present just views of it to others.&mdash;It
may be in us an ingrafted principle, too deep to be uprooted
by any rules, or reasons, or system of discipline; a habit
too unyieldingly become a part of our nature, to be overcome.
But with minds more docile, with temperaments more pliant,
with habits less fixed, it may be otherwise. The next generation
may transmit a more manly and less timid nature to the
generations to come. Education, building on the basis of
minds of more force, may then accomplish its perfect work,
imbuing them with a filial confidence in the Almighty, a
sense of the beauty of well-doing, and a perfect fearlessness
in regard to everything, but doing wrong. The happier generation
of that era, will be spared the agony of all deaths, but
the single one of nature; and will be fortified by discipline,
and the force of general opinion and example, to regard
this inevitable law of our being, this merciful provision of
providence, this rest for the worn and weary, as the hireling regards
the evening shade, when he reposes from his labors
and receives his reward. I shall elsewhere advert to this
evil in more detail, and point out such remedies, as appear
to me to be suggested by reason, education and religion.</p>

<p>This classification of the great divisions of our species, as
they are occupied in the pursuit of happiness, seems to me to
unite truth with poetry and philosophy, and to be both happy
and just. The disappointed, who affirm that the earth offers no
happiness, the gloomy, who view life as a place of penance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
austerity and tears, the dissipated and voluptuous, who seek
only pleasure, and whose doctrine is, that life offers no happiness
but in unbridled indulgence, the ambitious, who consider
happiness to consist only in wealth, power and distinction,
and a very numerous class, who have no object in view, but
to vegetate through life by chance, constitute the great mass
of mankind. The number of those who have lived by system,
and disciplined themselves to the wise and calculating pursuit
of happiness, has always been small. But there have still
been some, enough to prove the practicability of the art.&mdash;Wherever
we find a person, who declares that he has lived
happily, if his enjoyments have been of a higher kind, than
the mere vegetative easiness of a felicitous temperament and
an unthinking joyousness, we shall find on inquiry, that he
has been a philosopher in the highest and best sense. He may
scarcely understand the import of the term; but, however
ignorant of systems, and the learning of the schools, if he
have made it his chief business, to learn by the study of himself,
and general observation, how to be happy, he is the true
sage. He may well be content, let others regard him as they
may; for he has put in requisition the best wisdom of life.
No one maxim, especially, ever included more important and
practical truth, than that, to be happy, we must assiduously
train ourselves to retain through life a keen and juvenile
freshness of sensibility to enjoyment, and must early learn to
anticipate the effect of experience and years in cultivating a
stern indifference, a strong spirit of endurance, and unshrinking
obtuseness to pain. It has been my fortune to see examples
of persons who enjoyed life even to old age with all
the ardor and the quick perception of the young, and who
had always been as remarkable for their impassive and heroic
endurance of pain.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_3" id="NOTE_3"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_3"><span class="label">Note 3, page 43.</span></a></p>

<p>We are told, in ridicule of this study, that men have been
very happy without rules, and before any system had been
laid down, and will continue to be happy, unconscious of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
means by which they arrived at their enjoyment. So have
men reasoned without acquaintance with the rules of logic;
but this proves not the inutility of the study. Let the objector
convince us that the happy without thought and rules
would not have been happier if they had sought enjoyment
with the keen and practical intelligence of a Franklin.</p>

<p>Whatever men do well without definite aim and without
rules, it is clear to me, they would do better with these advantages.
The same argument equally militates with all
means of moral instruction. ‘The world,’ the objector may
say, ‘will proceed as before, say what we may.’ But this
would be deemed no just ground of objection to an attempt to
improve the age, though the efforts may have little visible
and apparent effect.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_4" id="NOTE_4"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_4"><span class="label">Note 4, page 44.</span></a></p>

<p>No term has been more hackneyed, in these days, than
education. We have had system upon system, and treatise
upon treatise; and more has been written and declaimed
upon this subject than almost any other. And yet, scarcely a
word has been said upon a grand and radical defect in all
existing systems which reduces to a very humble scale the
results of the best concerted efforts. I lay out of the question
all other incongruities, that I might easily mention, and come
directly to that which I have chiefly in my mind. Each of
the different instructors, through whose forming hands the
pupil passes, communicates to him different, militant and
incompatible impulses; so that, instead of a continuous operation
and an onward movement, it seems to be the work of each
successive teacher to undo that of all the others. The father
and mother, besides various minor inculcations, labor, as their
highest object, to infuse into the mind of their child, ambition,
the desire of preëminence and distinction. The school-master
instils the same principles under such different circumstances
as to render the envy, rivalry and competition of the school-room
almost another series of impulses. The minister and
the catechism enjoin humility, meekness and a disposition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
prefer others in honor before themselves. ‘Be honest and
high-minded,’ say the parents and teachers. ‘Be adroit, and
circumvent those who are watching to take advantage of your
weakness and inexperience,’ says the master at the counting-desk.
The elder friends teach one class of maxims, and the
younger another. The actual world inculcates rules different
from all the rest. Thus the parents, the school-master, the
minister, the politician, society and the world are continually
varying the direction of the youthful traveller. No wonder
that most people either have no character, or one that is a
compound of the most incongruous elements. A pupil, to
have a strong, wise, marked and efficient character, should
have had it steadily trained to one end; and every impulse
ought to have been in a right line and concurrent with every
other. Such must be the case before honest and uniform
characters will be formed.</p>

<p>There is little force in the objection, that he who has not
been constantly happy himself ought not to presume to teach
others to be happy. On the contrary, as the author beautifully
suggests, none can discuss, with so much experience and
force of truth, the dangers of shipwreck, as they who have
themselves suffered it. If the art of happiness can be taught,
the teacher must necessarily have paid the price of a qualification
to impart it, in having been himself unhappy. Conscious
that he had the susceptibility of enjoyment, and wanted only
the right direction of the means, he will be able to set up
way-marks, as a warning to others, at the points where he
remembers that he went astray himself.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_6" id="NOTE_6"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_6"><span class="label">Note 6, page 45.</span></a></p>

<p>The necessity of moderating our desires and reducing
them within the limits of what we may reasonably hope to
acquire, has been the beaten theme of prose and song for so
many ages that the triteness of repetition has finally caused
the great truth to be almost disregarded by moralists. Yet,
who can calculate the sum of torment that has been inflicted
by wild and unreasonable desires, by visionary and puerile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
expectations, beyond all probable bounds of means to realize
them, indulged and fostered until they have acquired the
force of habit! Whose memory cannot recur to sufferings
from envy and ill will, generated by cupidity, for the possessions
and advantages of others that we have not! Who
can count the pangs which he has endured from extravagant
and unattainable wishes! Poetry calls our mortal sojourn a
vale of tears; yet what ingenuity to multiply the gratuitous
means of self-torment! Has another health, wealth, beauty,
fortune, endowment, which I have not? Envy will neither
take them from him, nor transfer them to me. Why, then,
should I allow vultures to prey upon my spirit? Learn
neither to regret what you want and cannot supply, nor to
hate him who is more fortunate. With all his apparent advantages
over you, he wants, perhaps, what you may possess,
a tranquil mind. There is little doubt that you are the happier
person if you contemplate his advantages and his possessions
with a cheerful and unrepining spirit.</p>

<p>I present two considerations only, as inducements to control
and regulate your desires. 1. In indulging them beyond
reason you are fostering internal enemies and becoming a
self-tormentor. In the quaint language of the ancient
divines, they are like fire, good servants but terrible masters.
2d. The higher gifts of fortune, the common objects of envious
desire, are awarded to but a few. The number of those
who may entertain any reasonable hope of reaching them is
very small. But every one can moderate his desires. Every
one can set bounds to his ambition. Every one can limit his
expectations. What influence can fortune, events, or power
exercise over a person, who has learned to be content with a
little, and who has acquired courage to resign even that
without repining? Franklin might well smile at the impotent
malice of those who would deprive him of his means and
his business, when he proved to them that he could live on
turnips and rain water. It is not the less true or important,
because it has been a million times said, that happiness, the
creature of the mind, dwells not in external things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_7" id="NOTE_7"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_7"><span class="label">Note 7, page 47.</span></a></p>

<p>Wherever civilized man has been found, the first effort of
his mind, beyond the attainment of his animal wants, has been
to travel into the regions of imagination, to create a nobler
and more beautiful world than the dull and common-place
existing one, to assign to man a higher character and purer
motives than belong to the actual race. To possess a frame
inaccessible to pain and decay, and to dwell in eternal spring,
surrounded by beauty and truth, is an instinctive desire. A
mind of any fertility can create and arrange such a scene;
and in this dreaming occupation the sensations are tranquillizing
and pleasant beyond the more exciting enjoyment of
actual fruition. With the author, I deem the propensity for
this sort of meditation neither unworthy in itself, nor tending
to consequences to be deprecated. So far as my own experience
goes, and I am not without my share, it neither enervates
nor satiates. It furnishes enjoyment that is calm and
soothing; and such enjoyment, instead of enfeebling, invigorates
the mind to sustain trials and sorrows. Why should we
not enter into every enjoyment that is followed by no painful
consequences? Why should we not be happy when we
may? Is he not innocently employed who is imagining a
fairer scene&mdash;a better world&mdash;more benevolence, and more
joy than this ‘visible diurnal sphere’ affords? Addison is
never presented to me in a light so amiable as when he relates
his day-dreams, his universal empire, in which he puts down
all folly and all wickedness, and makes all his personages
good and happy. Every writer who has produced a romance
worth reading, has been endowed in this way, as a matter
of course; and I confidently believe that the greatest and
best of men have been most strongly inclined to this sort of
mental creation. May not their noblest achievements have
been the patterns of those archetypes? I have no doubt that
imaginings infinitely more interesting than any recorded in romances,
Arabian tales, or any other work of fiction, have imparted
their transient exhilaration to meditative minds, and have
passed away with the things that never grew into the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and concrete grossness of sensible existence. If ink and paper
and printing could have been created as cheaply and readily
as a new earth and better men and women, and scenes more
like what we hope for at last, the world would have had bequeathed
to it more volumes, than would have weighed down
all the ponderous dulness of by-gone romance. I cannot assure
myself, that you would have been amused, or instructed in
reading; but you would then have been able to form some idea
of the hours of pain, embarrassment, lack of all external means
of pleasant occupation, journeying, cold and watching, that
have been beguiled by this employment. I only add that, so
far as my experience extends, the first calm days of spring,
and the period of Indian summer in autumn are most propitious
to this sort of revery.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_8" id="NOTE_8"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_8"><span class="label">Note 8, page 48.</span></a></p>

<p>These and the subsequent views of ambition in this essay
of M. Droz, have been the theme of severe and sweeping
strictures upon the general tendency of his book. Ambitious
and aspiring men will find it ridiculous, of course, to exact, as
a pre-requisite to the pursuit of happiness, the abandonment,
or the moderation of ambitious thoughts, especially in such a
country as ours, where some boon is held out to tempt these
aspirings in almost every condition, from the mansion to the
cabin. It may not be amiss for men, who are themselves aspirants,
and to whom the access to distinction and power
is easy, and the attainment probable, to declaim against the
tendency of these maxims. I know well, that in every rank
and position, the inculcation of aspiring thoughts, emulation
and rivalry is the first and last lesson, the grand and beaten
precept, upon which the million are acting. I am well aware
how many hearts are wrung by all the fierce and tormenting
passions, associated with this devouring one. I affirm nothing
in regard to my own interior views, respecting what the world
calls fame, glory and immortality. Those who are most dear
to me, will not understand me to be entering my <em>caveat</em> to dissuade
them from this <em>last infirmity of noble minds</em>. Could I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
it with more eloquence than ever yet flowed from tongue or
pen, there will always be a hundred envious competitors for
every single niche in the temple of fame. It can be occupied
but by one; and he who gains it will exult in his elevation
only during its freshness and novelty. The rest, to the torment
of fostered and devouring desires, will add the bitterness
of disappointment.</p>

<p>Since it is a fact out of question, that the greater portion of
the species can never secure the objects of their ambition,
is it ill-judged in one who treats upon the science of happiness,
to write for the million instead of the few favorites of
fortune? The principles of a philosophic investigation ought
not to be narrowed down to meet the wishes of the few. The
question is, whether, taking into view ambition and all the associated
feelings, the toil of pursuit, and the difficulty and unfrequency
of the attainment of its objects, it is, on the whole,
favorable to happiness to cherish the passion, or not? I am
clear, that even the successful aspirants, if their rivalry were
more generous and philanthropic, and their indulgence of the
cankering and corroding of ill-concealed envy, derision, hate
and scorn, were regulated, would be not the less rapid in
reaching the goal, or happy in the fruition of their attainment.
I have little doubt, if an exact balance of enjoyment and suffering
could be struck, at the last hour between two persons, whose
circumstances in other respects had been similar, one of whom
had been distinguished in place and power, in consequence of
cultivating ambition; and the other obscure in peaceful privacy,
in consequence of having chosen that condition, that the
scale of happiness would decidedly incline in favor of the latter.
In a word, it is the index of sound calculation, to prepare for
the fate of the million, rather than that of the few. Repress
ambition, as much as we may, there will always remain enough
to render the world an aceldama, and the human heart a place
of concentrated torment.</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, to me, that in making up the debt and
credit account of life, in relation to happiness, most of the sentiments
associated with ambition, and its prolific family of
self-tormenting passions, may be set down as gratuitous items<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of misery, superinduced by our own voluntary discipline. I
shall be asked, what is to stimulate to exertion, to study, toil
and sacrifice, to great and noble actions, and what shall lead
to fame and renown, if this incentive be taken away? I answer,
that, what is ordinarily dignified with the appellation
of ambition, is a vile mixture of the worst feelings of our nature.
There is in all minds, truly noble, a sufficient impulse
towards great actions, apart from these movements, which
are generally the excitements of little and mean spirits. Take
the whole nature of man into the calculation, and there can
never be a want of sufficient impulse towards distinction, without
a particle of those contemptible motives, which are generally
put to the account of praiseworthy incitement. Truly great
men have been remarkable for their exemption from envy, the
inseparable concomitant of conscious deficiency; and for a
certain calm and tranquil spirit, indicating moderation and
comparative indifference in the struggle of emulation. They
are able to say, in regard to the highest boon of ambition,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘I neither spurn, nor for the favor call,</p>
<p class="verse">It comes unasked-for, if it comes at all.’</p>
</div></div>

<p>Why, then, in a world, and in an order of society, where
ambition, with its associated passions, brings in an enormous
amount to the mass of human self-inflicted torment, should he
be censured, who advises, that in the philosophic and calculating
pursuit of happiness, this element of misery should be,
as much as possible, repressed? The question may be more
strongly urged, when we take into the account, the consideration,
that the far greater portion of the species must calculate
on the bitterness of disappointment, in addition to the
miseries which are inseparable from the indulgence of this
passion. All the inordinate thirst for power and fame of the
countless aspirants, who desire to be Alexanders, Cæsars and
Napoleons, not only is so much subtracted from their enjoyment,
and added to their misery, but has little tendency to
aid them to attainments, which, after all, are as frequently the
award of contingency, as of calculation.</p>

<p>Let the evils of retirement and obscurity, be fairly balanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
with those of gratified ambition, and let the aspirant feel, that
they are absolutely incompatible, the one with the other.&mdash;Let
him then make his election, in view of the consequences,
and not foolishly expect that he can unite incompatible advantages.
If he chooses the dust and scramble of the arena, and
the intoxicating pleasures at the goal, let him not repine, that
he cannot unite with them those of repose, retirement and a
tranquil mind. If, on the contrary, he prefers to hold on the
noiseless tenor of his way, in peace and privacy, let not the
serpents of envy sting him, when he sees the car of the fortunate
aspirant drawn forward by the applauding million. Let
not murmurs arise in his heart, when he hears, or reads of the
rewards, honors and immortality of those whom he may believe
to be endowed no higher than himself with talents or
virtues. Let him say, ‘no one can show me the mind, or paint
me the consciousness of that man. Fortune and my own
choice have assigned me the shade. Let me not embitter
its coolness and its satisfactions, by idle desires to unite advantages,
that are, in their nature, incongruous. Let me remember,
that mine is the condition of the million. My Creator
cannot have doomed so vast a proportion of his creatures
to a state, which is necessarily miserable. All that remains
to me, is to make the best of the common lot.’</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_9" id="NOTE_9"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_9"><span class="label">Note 9, page 50.</span></a></p>

<p>Severe strictures have, also, been passed upon this maxim.
I well know, that the common rules proposed to the young, in
commencing their serious and more advanced studies, lead
them to look forward to happiness, as a garland suspended
from the goal, an object only in remote expectation, the fruition
of which should be hoped for only at a period of life,
when few are capable of enjoyment, even if the means were
in their power. To calculate on comfort and repose, early
in life, has been considered as a sort of effeminate weakness.</p>

<p>These unphilosophic views of education have, more than almost
any other, thrown over the whole course of preparatory
discipline for life, a repulsive gloom, tending to fill the mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the pupil with dismay and disgust in view of his studies.&mdash;The
young should be early imbued with the sentiment, that
God sent them here to be happy, not in indolence, intoxication,
voluptuousness or insanity; but in earnest and vigorous
discipline for coming duties. And at this bright epoch, when
nature spreads a charm over existence, a philosophic teacher
may easily train them to invest their studies, labors, and pursuits,
and perhaps even their privations and severer toils, with
a coloring of cheerfulness and gayety, when contemplated
as the only means of discipline by which they may hope to
reach a desired end. They should be trained to meet events,
and brave the shock of adversity with a firm and searching
purpose, to find either a way to mitigate the pressure, or to
increase self-respect by the noble pride of manifesting to themselves,
with how much calmness and patient endurance they
can overcome the inevitable ills of their condition. In other
words, they should make enjoyment a means, as well as an end,
that they may carry onward, from their first days, an accumulating
stock of happiness, with which courage and cheerfulness
may paint future anticipations in the mellow lustre of
past remembrances. In this way the bow of promise may be
made to bend its brilliant arch over every period of this transient
existence, connecting what has been, and what will be,
in the same radiant span.</p>

<p>Entertaining such views of the direction which might be
given to the juvenile mind, I mourn over those weak parents,
who are nursing their children with effeminate fondness, not
allowing the <em>winds to visit them too roughly</em>, pampering their
wishes, instead of teaching them to repress them: and rather
striving to ward from them all pains and privations, than
teaching them that they must encounter innumerable sorrows
and disappointments, and disciplining them to breast the ills
of life with a conquering fortitude. Opulence generally gives
birth to this injudicious plan of parental education. Penury,
as little directed by sound views, but impelled by the stern
teaching of necessity, imparts to the children of the poor, a
much more salutary discipline, and they ordinarily come forward
with a more robust spirit, with more vigor, power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
elasticity; and it is in this way, that providence adjusts the
balance of advantages between these different conditions.</p>

<p>We have all admired the practical philosophy of the man,
who, when sick of a painful disease, thanked God that
he was not subject to a still more painful one; and when
under the pressure of the latter, found cause for cheerfulness,
that he was not visited with both diseases at the
same time. Akin to this was the noble fortitude of the mariner,
who, when a limb was carried away by a cannon-ball,
congratulated himself that it was not his head. I do not say
that any one can find cheerfulness in contemplating such
Spartan spirits, but that a philosophy of this sort would disarm
the common ills of life of much of their power, and would
even enable the sufferer to find enjoyment in the midst of them.</p>

<p>It would be no disadvantage even to the ambitious and aspiring
to abstract, from the toils of their pursuit, the bitter and
corroding spirit of rivalry and envy, and in its stead to cultivate
sentiments of kindness, complacency and moderation. Let
their ends be so noble, as to give an air of dignity to the
means that they employ, and they will throw a splendor of
self-respect over their course. Let the aspirant say, ‘I struggle
not for myself, but to procure competence for aged parents,
to gild their declining years with the view of my success.
It is for dependent relatives, orphans, the poor and
friendless, whom Providence has given particular claims on
me, that I struggle. It is to benefit and gladden those who are
dearer to me than life, and not for my own sordid vanity and
ambition, that I strive to toil up the ascent of fame.</p>

<p>In fine, the author, while he inculcates the maxim that we
should, from the beginning, study to number happy days,
would not teach, as he has been charged with teaching, that
we may give labor and study and the toil of preparation to
the winds, and consult only the indolent leading of our passions;
for he knows, as do we all, that this course results in
anything but ‘happy days.’ He would send us, on the contrary,
in pursuit of happiness, to the teaching of wisdom and
experience, that never bestow impracticable lessons. He
would only inculcate, that while others have taught us to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
ultimate happiness through means of pain, we should make
the means themselves immediate sources of enjoyment. It
is a fact out of question, that we may train ourselves to find
enjoyment in those toils and privations, which are to others,
sources of disgust and sorrow. Who has not thrilled, as he
read of the author, who, oppressed with cares, infirmities and
years, took leave of a book, the result of the most laborious and
protracted study, that was to be published only after his death,
with a pleasant ode of thankfulness to it, as having furnished
him agreeable occupation, and beguiled years of sorrow and
pain? On this subject, I too can speak experimentally. I
have often experienced an inward conscious satisfaction in
realizing the pleasure and enjoyment, which I found in the
same pursuits and labors, which were the most painful drudgery
to others, equally qualified to pursue them with myself.
The bee extracts honey from the same flower which to the
spider yields only poison.</p>

<p>Nothing but experience can teach us to what extent
force of character, and a capacity without cowardly shrinking,
to face danger, pain and death, may be acquired.&mdash;Compare,
for example, a militia-man torn from the repose
of his retreat, and forced into immediate battles, with the
same person in the same predicament, when he shall have become
a trained veteran. Compare the only child of weak,
fond and opulent parents, as he is seen in the hour of apprehended
shipwreck, or of fierce conflict with the enemy, with
the sailor-boy, born in the same vicinity, but compelled by
the rough discipline of poverty, to encounter the elements,
and the aspect of danger and death from boyhood.</p>

<p>I shall take occasion hereafter, to remark on the stubborn
and invincible apathy of the red men of our forests, in
the endurance of slow fire, and all the forms of torture, which
the ingenuity of Indian revenge can devise. I no longer
trace this apparent insensibility to pain and fear, as I formerly
did, to a more callous frame, and nerves of obtuser feeling.
I see in it the astonishing result of their institutions, and the
influence of public opinion upon them. In the same connexion,
I shall remark upon the testimony which the conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
martyrs bears to the same point. Place a sufficient motive
before the sufferer, and the proper witnesses around him, and
he may be disciplined to endure anything without showing
a subdued spirit. The most timid woman will not shrink from
a surgical operation, when those she loves and respects, surround
her and applaud her courage. Leave her alone with
the surgeon, and the very sight of his instrument will produce
shrieks and faintings. The mad personage who leaped the
Genesee falls, fell a victim, to the influence which encouraged
vanity and ambition exert upon their subject to spur him on
to any degree of daring. If the right application of a motive,
so little worthy as the mere gratification of a moment’s vanity,
can harden the spirit for such attempts, what might not be effected
by a discipline, wisely guided by a simple purpose to impart
force, energy and unshrinking courage, to meet and vanquish
the inevitable evils of life? To me there is nothing incredible
in the story of the Spartan boy, who had stolen the
fox, and allowed the animal, while concealed under his mantle,
to tear his entrails, rather than, by uttering a groan, to
commit his character for hardihood and capability of adroit
thieving. Parents, your children will be compelled to encounter
fatigue, privation and pain, under any circumstances
in which they can be placed. You can easily pamper them
to an effeminacy that will shrink from any effort, and, if I may
so quote, ‘to die of a rose in aromatic pain;’ to be feeble,
timid, repining, and yet voluptuous. You can as easily teach
them to find pleasure in labor, and in the sentiment of that
force of mind, with which they can firmly meet pain, privation,
danger and death. Train them for the world in which they
are destined to live. Teach them to <em>quit themselves like men,
and be strong</em>.</p>

<p>It is impossible to present a better summary of the essentials
of happiness. As the author remarks, they are difficult
to unite. Yet, whoever lacks either, must be peculiarly unfortunate,
or indulgent to himself, if he cannot trace the want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to some aberration or neglect of his own. Health, perhaps, is
the least within our power; for, by the fault of our ancestors,
we may have inherited a constitution and temperament essentially
vitiated and unhealthy. We may lose health by casualty
or by the influence of causes utterly beyond our knowledge
or our control. But for one person thus afflicted with
want of health, it is notorious that a hundred are so from
causes which they may trace to their own mismanagement.
Tranquillity of mind, is certainly a frame, on which we have a
controlling influence. Whoever, in our country, has not competence,
must assuredly seek the cause, if he have health, in
his own want of industry or management. Most of the complaints
of the caprice, infidelity and unworthiness of friends
would have a more equitable application to our own want of
temper, truth and disinterestedness. These things, indispensable
to happiness, are far more subject to our command, than
our self-flattery will allow us to imagine. The greater portion
of those about us might unite all these advantages. Yet, if all
misery, other than that which arises from want of being able
to unite all these numerous and difficult requisites to happiness,
were abstracted from human nature, I am confident that
a moiety of the sorrows of earth would be removed; in other
words, that a philosophic pursuit of happiness, would at once
deliver us from more than half of our suffering here below.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_11" id="NOTE_11"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_11"><span class="label">Note 11, page 59.</span></a></p>

<p>The memory of almost every person who has been present
at a funeral, attended by a protestant minister of a certain
class, will furnish him with recollections of these preposterous
harangues of attempted consolation. The mourners are instructed
that it is sinful to grieve; that grief implies want of
faith in the great truths of the gospel; that Christianity forbids
it; and, more than all, that it argues doubt of the happiness
of the deceased; or a murmuring want of submission to
the Divine will. Such doctrines, in the minds of weak and
superstitious mourners who feel that it is not in their power
to repress grief, inspire painful distrust and self-reproach;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and, in men more disciplined in the ways of the world, and
more acquainted with human nature, contempt for the ignorant
folly or gross hypocrisy of the declaimer. The unchanging
constitution of human nature revolts at such maxims.
Whoever affects to be insensible to the loss of a child, relative,
or friend, is either a stranger to his own perceptions,
practises deceit, or has no heart to be grieved. Christianity
is preëminently the religion of tenderness, and forbids the
indulgence of no inherent emotion of our nature within its
proper limits. It is most absurd of all, to suppose that God has
forbidden, or interprets as murmurs, the sorrows that we feel
from his stroke. There are few persons so disinterested,
even if they were assured beyond a doubt, that the person
they mourn is happy, as not to grieve at the final earthly
severance which cuts off the accustomed communion of heart;
and interdicts the mourner from the sight and participation
of that happiness. The cause of Christianity has suffered
beyond calculation, from the exaggeration of its requirements
by weak enthusiasts, or designing bigots. Distorted views
and impracticable requisitions have disgusted more persons
with the system of the gospel than Hume’s argument against
miracles, or all the sophistry of unbelief. The gospel takes
into view the whole nature of man, and all its precepts announce,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolumus leges naturæ mutari</i>&mdash;<em>we will that the laws
of nature should not be changed</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_12" id="NOTE_12"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_12"><span class="label">Note 12, page 61.</span></a></p>

<p>It is not necessary to recur to the history of great revolutions
to furnish the most impressive examples of human vicissitude
and instability. The Latin poet had reason for his
maxim, who said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Si fortuna juvat caveto tolli;</p>
<p class="verse">Si fortuna tonat caveto mergi.’</p>
</div></div>

<p>Life in every country and in all time has been full of affecting
instances of the young, beautiful, endowed and opulent
struck down in the brightest presage of their dawn. That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the true philosophy which draws, from continual exposure to
these blows, a motive, to make the most, in the way of innocent
enjoyment, of the period that is in our power.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_13" id="NOTE_13"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_13"><span class="label">Note 13, page 62.</span></a></p>

<p>This beautiful painting furnishes an impressive emblem of
the capability of the human constitution, corporeal and mental,
to assimilate itself to any change; and of becoming insensible,
by habit, to any degree of uniform endurance. Those fanatics
in the early ages of the church, preposterously called
saints, and others like them, professing all forms of religion,
that may still be found in the oriental countries, who
sit for years on a pillar under the open sky, or curve themselves
into a half circle and remain in that position until their
forms grow to it, shortly cease to feel much uneasiness in a
posture which becomes habitual. To restore them to their
original forms, after nature has affixed her seal of consent
to the distortion, would, probably, cause as much pain as
was requisite to acquire the habit. We have all read the
affecting tale of the prisoner released from the Bastille after
a confinement of more than a quarter of a century. He found
the ordinary pursuits and intercourse of life insupportable,
and begged to be restored to his dungeon. This is a most
important aspect of the nature of man which parents and instructers
have as yet scarcely taken into view in their efforts
to mould the youthful character. Children can as easily be
formed to be Spartans as Sybarites; and, in the former case,
they not only acquire the noble attributes of courage and
force of character, but contract habits of patient and manly
endurance, furnishing a better shield against the ills of life
than any in the command of opulence or foresight.</p>

<p>‘Fate leads the willing, drags the unwilling on,’ and the
single question is, by which of these processes would we
choose to meet our lot? No doctrine of the true philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
lies so obviously on the surface as the wisdom of resignation;
the disposition, in the exercise of which, more than in any
order, a wise man differs from the million of murmuring and
repining beings about him, who are madly struggling with the
inexorable powers of nature, and doubting their evils by this
useless and painful resistance. When we can no longer
either evade or resist fortune, we can, at least, half disarm
her by a calm and manly resignation.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_15" id="NOTE_15"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_15"><span class="label">Note 15, page 69.</span></a></p>

<p>The instinctive sentiment of the love of country and home
is beautifully described in these paragraphs. In health and
good fortune, the amusements and distractions of life, may
keep this sentiment out of sight. But ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulces moriens reminiscitur
Argos</i>’ is the feeling with which most strangers die in
a foreign land. In every heart, rightly constituted, the moment
the absence of adventitious pleasures forces the mind
back upon itself, the instinctive feeling resumes its original
force. It seems to me always an unfavorable trait in the
character of an immigrant from abroad, that he is disposed
to speak unfavorably of his native country, or does not seem
to prefer it to all others. God has wrought into the mind
of every good man a filial feeling towards his native country.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_15a" id="NOTE_15a"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_15a"><span class="label">Note 15a, page 69.</span></a></p>

<p>None of the sentiments and maxims of M. Droz have been
more severely censured than those of the succeeding paragraphs.
I am as little disposed to inculcate an indolent philosophy,
as any other person. These views seem peculiarly
unfitted for the genius of our country, where everything respires,
as it ought, energy, industry, a fixed purpose and a
keen pursuit. That such are the requirements of our institutions
is a truth too strongly forced upon us by the order of
everything in our country, to require any other proof. I
would be the last person to feel disposed to recommend a
philosophy, which would tend to quench that busy and daring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
spirit which is the most striking characteristic of our nation.
No elevation or opulence among us can dispense with a definite
pursuit. So forcibly is every citizen reminded of this,
by all he sees about him, that without a pursuit, no one among
us can sustain his own self-respect. He, who courts seclusion
and retirement, on the principles of the author is obliged,
even in his retirement, to keep himself engaged. He must devote
himself to agriculture, manufactures, or some other absorbing
pursuit.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that no American is in danger
of subscribing to his disqualifying views of the law, or any
other profession. A freeman ought to hold, that he can confer
respectability upon whatever pursuit circumstances may
impel him to follow. Happily, no harm would result, in our
country, from the dislike of the author to the law. By what
seems to me an unhappy general consent among us, the law
is absorbing in the temptations that it offers to our young
men. It is the prescribed avenue to all honor and place. All
our functionaries must have passed into the temple of power
and fame through this portico. Hence it is, and probably long
will be thronged by a great corps of supernumeraries. I would
certainly be the last, not to think respectfully of the profession;
but still I dislike to see so many of our aspiring young men
crowding into it, to meet inevitable disappointment.</p>

<p>But critics will moderate their strictures upon the author,
when they call to mind, that although there is no such class,
as people of leisure in our country, it constitutes a great and
powerful one in France; perhaps greater in proportion, than
any other country. The chief application of these paragraphs
must be to men of that condition, of whom the better class
make literature at once their amusement and pursuit. For
such, these are, probably, the wisest and best precepts that
could be given. The whole of that part of this chapter, which
inculcates an inactive retirement, is altogether calculated for
another meridian, than that of our country. I have entirely
omitted some of the passages, as not only of erroneous general
tendency, but altogether inapplicable to any order of things
among us. But admitting this, and a few other trifling exceptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
I have been astonished at the charges which have
been brought against the moral tendency of the general opinions
of M. Droz.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_16" id="NOTE_16"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_16"><span class="label">Note 16, page 73.</span></a></p>

<p>This short chapter upon health seems to me full of the soundest
practical wisdom. Every one must be aware, that the wise
pursuit of happiness must be preceded by the preserving of
health. The wise ancients justly made the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens sana in corpore
sano</i>, to be the condition, if not the essence of human happiness.
Most treatises upon health have oppressed the subject
by too many, and too intricate rules. It would be difficult to
add to the author’s precepts, brief as they are, so far as they
relate to the moral and intellectual regimen necessary to
health. I add a remark, or two, touching some physical appliances,
that should be appended to the moral rules.</p>

<p>So far as my reading and observation extend, there are but
three circumstances, which have almost invariably accompanied
health and longevity. The favored persons have lived
in elevated rather than in low and marshy positions; have been
possessed of a tranquil and cheerful temperament, and active
habits; and have been early risers.</p>

<p>It is related that the late King George the Third, who made
the causes of longevity a subject of constant investigation,
procured two persons, each considerably over a hundred years
of age, to dance in his presence. He then requested them to
relate to him their modes of living, that he might draw from
them, if possible, some clue to the causes of their vigorous
old age. The one had been a shepherd, remarkably temperate
and circumspect in his diet and regimen; the other a
hedger, equally noted for the irregularity, exposure, and
intemperance of his life. The monarch could draw no inference,
to guide his inquiries, from such different modes of life,
terminating in the same result. On further inquiry, he
learned, that they were alike distinguished by a tranquil
easiness of temper, active habits, and early rising.</p>

<p>After all the learned modern expositions of the causes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
dyspepsia, I suspect that not one in a thousand is aware how
much temperance and moderation in the use of food conduce
to health. There are very few among us who do not daily
consume twice the amount of food, necessary to satisfy the
requisitions of nature. The redundant portion must weigh
as a morbid and unconcocted mass upon the wheels of life.
Every form of alcohol is unquestionably a poison, slow or rapid,
in proportion to the excess in which it is used. Disguise
it is as we may, be the pretexts of indulgence as ingenious and
plausible, as inclination and appetite can frame, it retains its
intrinsic tendencies under every sophistication. Wine, in
moderation, is, doubtless, less deleterious than any of its disguises.
In declining age, and in innumerable cases of debility,
it may be indicated as a useful remedy; but even here,
only as a less evil to countervail a greater. Pure water, all
other circumstances equal, is always a healthier beverage for
common use. Next to temperance, a quiet conscience, a
cheerful mind, and active habits, I place early rising, as a means
of health and happiness. I have hardly words for the estimate
which I form of that sluggard, male or female, that has
formed the habit of wasting the early prime of day in bed.&mdash;Laying
out of the question the positive loss of life, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magna
pars dempta solido de die</i>, and that too of the most inspiring
and beautiful part of the day, when all the voices of nature
invoke man from his bed; leaving out of the calculation, that
longevity has been almost invariably attended by early rising;
to me, late hours in bed present an index to character, and an
omen of the ultimate hopes of the person who indulges in this
habit. There is no mark, so clear, of a tendency to self-indulgence.
It denotes an inert and feeble mind, infirm of purpose,
and incapable of that elastic vigor of will which enables
the possessor always to accomplish what his reason ordains.
The subject of this unfortunate habit cannot but have felt
self-reproach, and a purpose to spring from his repose with
the freshness of the dawn. If the mere indolent luxury of
another hour of languid indulgence is allowed to carry it over
this better purpose, it argues a general weakness of character,
which promises no high attainment or distinction.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>These
are never awarded by fortune to any trait, but vigor,
promptness and decision. Viewing the habit of late rising,
in many of its aspects, it would seem as if no being, that has
any claim to rationality, could be found in the allowed habit
of sacrificing a tenth, and that the most pleasant and spirit-stirring
portion of life, at the expense of health, and the curtailing
of the remainder, for any pleasure which this indulgence
could confer.</p>

<p>From personal experience and no inconsiderable range of
observation, I am convinced that the author has by no means
overrated the influence of imagination upon health and disease.
It is indeed astonishing, at this late period, when
every physiologist and physician is ready to proclaim his own
recorded observations upon the medicinal influence of the
moral powers, the passions, and especially the imagination,
that so few medical men have thought it an object to employ
them as elements of actual application. Hitherto these unknown
and undefined powers of life and death have been in
the hands of empirics, jugglers, mountebanks and pretended
dispensers of miraculous healing. It is, at the same time,
matter of regret, that scientific physicians, instead of questioning
their undeniable cures, and pouring attempted ridicule
upon them, have not separated the true from the false, and
sought access to the real fountain of the efficacy of their
practice, the employment of confident faith, hope, and the unlimited
agency of the all pervading power of the imagination.
Many physicians are sufficiently wise, and endowed with
character, to exercise circumspection in giving their opinions
and pronouncing upon the prognostics of their patients.
They regulate their words, countenance and deportment with
a caution and prudence which speak volumes in regard to
their conviction of the influence which imprudence in these
points might have.</p>

<p>In fact, it is only necessary to observe the intense and
painful earnestness with which the patient and the friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
watch his countenance and behaviour, to be aware what an
influence may be thus exerted. It is only requisite to understand
with what prying anxiety the sick man questions those
around him, what the physician thinks and predicts of his
case, to make him sensible how vigilantly he should be on
his guard, in spending his judgment rashly in the case. All
this negative wisdom, in the application of moral means, is
sufficiently common. Not to possess it, in a considerable degree,
would indicate a physician unacquainted with the most
common etiquette of a sick chamber.</p>

<p>But, as yet, we see the positive employment of these means
almost wholly interdicted by custom to regular physicians.
We contend for their exercise only within the limits of the
most scrupulous veracity and the most severe discretion.
What powers would he not exert, who, snatching these moral
means from the hands of empirics, and who, to thorough acquaintance
with all that can be known in regard to physical
means, should join the wise and discriminating aid of an
imagination creating a healing world of hope and confidence
about the patient? Such a benefactor of our species will,
ere long, arise, who will introduce a new era into medicine.</p>

<p>Who can doubt that implicit faith in the healing powers
of prince Hohenlohe may have wrought cures, even in cases
of paralysis, without the least necessity for introducing the
vague and misapplied term, a miracle; or that some out of
many persons in an asylum of paralytics would find themselves
able to fly when bombs fell upon the roof of their
receptacle?</p>

<p>The influence of a vigorous will upon the physical movements
of our frame has scarcely been conjectured, much less
submitted to the scrutiny of experiment. Yet it would be
easy, I think, to select innumerable cases where, by its
means, men have exerted powers previously unknown to
themselves. We see the immediate application of almost
superhuman energy upon the access of frenzy to the patient;
and this affords conclusive proof that, upon the addition of
the due amount of excitement, the body and mind become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
capable of incredible exertions, and yet sink into infantine
debility the moment that the excitement is withdrawn. Every
one has been made aware of what mere resolution can do, in
sustaining the frame in cases of cold, exposure, hunger and
exhaustion. All these instances are only different forms of
proof, which might be multiplied indefinitely, of the agency of
moral powers upon physical nature. Under similar influences,
omens and predictions, in weak and superstitious minds, become
adequate causes of their own completion. Since perfect
knowledge alone can deliver the mind from more or less
susceptibility of this influence, it is important that it should
be wisely directed to bear, as far as it may, upon the imagination,
in kindling it to confidence, cheerfulness and hope.</p>

<p>Because he was sustained by a cheerful reliance upon
Providence, a firm determination to do his duty, and have no
fear of consequences. The whole scope of my own observation,
beside the sick bed, perfectly coincides with these views.
I do not say that there are not numberless exceptions. But
of this I am confident, that the general rule is, that persons
who attend the sick and dying, in cases of epidemic disease
of a mortal type, with a fearless and cheerful mind, escape;
while the timid, who are alarmed and have an implicit belief
in the danger of contagion, succumb.</p>

<p>If there ever was an age when invalids and the suffering
might promise themselves sympathy in the dolorous detail
of their symptoms, which is questionable, it certainly is not
now, during the era of labor-saving machinery, political
economy, and the all-engrossing influence of money and corporate
achievement. He who now suffers from acute pain,
in any form, will do wisely to summon all his strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
philosophy to suppress any manifestation in his countenance
and muscles, rather than task his eloquence in framing his
tale of symptoms.</p>

<p>This whole chapter upon health abounds in the highest
practical wisdom, and the hints in it might easily be expanded
to a volume. I only add, that I earnestly recommend a poem
upon the same subject, one, as it seems to me, among the
most classical and beautiful in our language, and which has
become strangely and undeservedly obsolete&mdash;Dr Armstrong’s
Art of Health.</p>

<p>How often have similar thoughts pressed upon my mind, as I
have stood over the bed of the sick and dying! Here is the peculiar
empire of minds truly and nobly benevolent, where the
head and main prop of a family is preparing to conflict with
the last enemy: where pain and groans, terror and death, fill
the foreground, and the dim but inevitable perspective of
desolation, struggle and want, in contact with indifference
and selfishness, opens in the distance before the survivors.
Let us thank God for religion. Philosophy may inculcate
stern endurance and wise submission; but knows not a fit
and adequate remedy. The hopes and the example imparted
by him <em>who went about doing good</em>, are alone sufficient for
the relief of such cases, of which, alas! our world is full.</p>

<p>No view of human life is more consoling or just than that
presented in these paragraphs. Yet no human calculation
will ever reach the sum of agony that has been inflicted by the
jealousy, envy and heart-burning that have resulted from that
most erroneous persuasion, that certain conditions and circumstances
of life bring happiness in themselves. Beautifully
has the bible said, that ‘God has set one thing over
against another’&mdash;has balanced the real advantages of the
different human conditions. The result of my experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
would leave me in doubt and at a loss, in selecting the condition
which I should deem most congenial to happiness. I
should have to balance abundance of food, on the one hand,
against abundance of appetite, on the other; the habit superinduced
by the necessity of being satisfied with a little, with
the habit of being disgusted with the trial of much. There
are joys, numerous and vivid, peculiar to the rich; and others,
in which none but those in the humbler conditions of life can
participate. In the whole range of the enjoyment of the
senses, if there be any advantage, it belongs to the poor.
The laws of our being have surrounded the utmost extent of
human enjoyment with adamantine walls, which one condition
can no more overleap than another. It is wonderful to see
this admirable adjustment, like the universal laws of nature,
acting everywhere and upon everything. Even in the physical
world, what is granted to one country is denied to
another; and the wanderer who has seen strange lands and
many cities, in different climes, only returns to announce, as
the sum of his experience and the teaching of years, that
light and shadow, comfort and discomfort, pleasure and pain,
like air and water, are diffused in nearly similar measures
over the whole earth.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_21a" id="NOTE_21a"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_21a"><span class="label">Note 21a, page 88.</span></a></p>

<p>It needs but little acquaintance with human condition to
perceive, in the general adjustment of advantages settled by
Providence, that great proportions of them have been thrown
into opposite scales, and so contrasted that the selection of
one class implies the rejection of the other. For example,
smitten with the thousand temptations of wealth, you are
determined to be rich. Be it so. Industry, frugality and the
convergence of your faculties to this single point will hardly
fail to render you so. But then you will not be so absurd as
to envy another the fame of talents and acquirements which
required absorbing devotion to pursuits incompatible with
yours.</p>

<p>You are rich, and complain of satiety and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>. Knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
you not, when you determined to be rich, that poor people
sing and dance about their cabin fires? You have gained
power and distinction and discovered the heartless selfishness
of your competitors and dependents. Were you ignorant
that friendship can only be purchased by friendship; and
that, in selecting your all-engrossing pursuit, you have precluded
yourself from furnishing your quota of the reciprocity?
The choices of life are alternatives. You may select from
this scale, or that. But, in most cases, you cannot take from
both. How much murmuring would be arrested if this most
obvious truth were understood and men would learn to be
satisfied with their alternative! Choose wisely and deliberately;
and then quietly repose on your choice. Say, ‘I have
this; another has that. I am certain that I have my choice.
I do not know but his condition was forced upon him.’</p>

<p>If I have ever allowed myself the indulgence of envy, it is
after having tasted the pleasure of rewarding merit, or relieving
distress, in thinking how continually such celestial satisfactions
are within the reach of the opulent. What a calm
is left in the mind after having wiped away tears! What
aspirations are excited in noting the joy and gratitude consequent
upon misery relieved! How delightful to recur to the
remembrance during the vigils of the night watches! How
it expands the heart to reflect upon the consciousness of the
all powerful and all good Being, measuring the circuit of the
universe in doing good! Unhappily, the experience of all
time demonstrates that the possession of opulence and power
not only has no direct tendency to inspire increased sensibility
to such satisfactions, but has an opposite influence. For
one, rendered more kind and benevolent by good fortune, how
many become callous, selfish and proud by it! Kindly and
wisely has Providence seen fit to spare most men this dangerous
trial.</p>

<p>This chapter of the author, among the rest, has been obnoxious
to severe strictures. I am sensible that the young
require the exercise of cautious discretion in few questions
more than in this, ‘How far is it wise to disregard public
opinion?’ To press the point too far is to incur the reputation
of eccentricity and arrogant confidence in our own judgment.
Implicitly to copy the expressions and habits of the multitude
precludes all pursuit of happiness by system; and reduces
the whole inquiry to the injunction, to walk with the
rest, and add our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> and disappointment to the mass of
the unhappiness of all those who have gone before. If certain
modes appear to me, after the most deliberate examination,
conducive to my happiness, why should I be deterred
from adopting them, because I am not countenanced by the
general opinion and example of a crowd, each individual of
which I should altogether reject as a teacher and an example?
If I avow that the ten thousand, in all time, have formed the
most erroneous judgments, touching the wisdom of human
pursuits, why should I continue blindly to copy their errors?
He is certainly the most fortunate man who, if an exact
account of his sensations and thoughts could be cast into a
sum at his last hour, would be found to have enjoyed the
greatest number of agreeable moments, pleasurable sensations
and happy reflections. If to court retirement, repose,
the regulation of the desires and passions, and the cultivation
of those affections which are best nurtured in the shade, be
the most certain route to happiness, why should I be swayed
from choosing that path by the suggestions of ambition, avarice
and the spirit of the world, which enjoin the common
course?</p>

<p>Yet every one is, more or less, a slave to the prevalent
fashions of thinking and acting. How much vile hypocrisy
does this slavery which covers the face of society with a vast
mask of semblance, engender? Contemplate the routine of
all the professions which we make and infringe in a single
day, in the manifest violation of our inward thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
belief; and we must admit that the world agrees to enact a
general lie, alike deceiving and deceived, through terror of
being the first to revolt against the thraldom of opinion. The
very persons, too, who cherish the profoundest secret contempt
for the judgment of the multitude, are generally the
loudest and the first in decrying any departure from the
standard of public opinion almost as an immorality.</p>

<p>I would by no means desire to see those most dear to me
arrogantly setting at defiance received ideas and usages.
These have, as the author justly remarks, a salutary moral
sway in repressing the influence of the impudent and abandoned.
I am not insensible to the danger of following our
independent judgment beyond the limits of a regulated discretion.
But there is no trait in the young for which I feel
a more profound respect, than the fixed resolve to consult
their own light, in setting the rules of their conduct and
selecting their alternatives. A calm and reflecting independence,
an unshaken firmness in encountering vulgar prejudices,
is what I admire as the evidence of strong character,
fearless thinking and capability of self-direction.</p>

<p>How often must every reflecting mind have been led to
similar views of human nature! To form just estimates and
entertain right sentiments of our kind, we must not contemplate
men under the action of the narrowness of sectarian
hate, or through the jaundiced vision of party feeling. We
must see them in positions like those so happily presented by
the author, when great and sweeping calamities level men to
the consciousness and the sympathies of a common nature,
and a sense of common exposure to misery, and open the
fountains of generous feeling. Who has not seen men, on
such occasions, forget their pride, their miserable questions
of rank and precedence, and meet with open arms and the
mingled tears of gratitude and relief, persons, the view of
whom under other circumstances, would have called forth
only feelings of scornful comparison and reckless contempt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The incident of the hostile French and German posts is a
singularly touching one. In what a horrid light does it place
the character and passions of princes, generals, conquerors
and warriors, in all time, who for their measureless cupidity,
or the whim of their ambition, have used these amiable beings,
formed with natural sympathies to aid and love each other,
as the mechanical engines of their purposes, to meet breast
to breast as enemies, and plunge the murderous steel into each
others’ hearts! Hence, rivers of life blood have flowed as
uselessly as rain falls upon the ocean! It is difficult to determine
whether we ought most to execrate the accursed ambition
of the few, or despise the weak stupidity of the many
who have been led, unresistingly, like animals to the slaughter,
only the more firmly to rivet the chains of the survivors.
What a view does war present, of the miserable ignorance,
the brute stupidity of the mass of the species, and the detestable
passions of those called the great, in all time! Who
does not exult to see the era, every day approaching, when
men will be too wise, too vigilant and careful of their rights
to become instruments in the hands of others; when the
rational consciousness of their own predominant physical
power shall be guided by wisdom, self-watchfulness and self-respect?
Then, instead of being tamely led out to slay each
other, when invoked to this detestable sport of kings, they
will show their steel to their oppressors.</p>

<p>I am as much impressed with the eloquence of this passage
as with its truth. I reserve more particular views of religion
for comments on the letter upon the subject. I wish to present
in this place, as consonant with the spirit of this passage,
one view of religion which has long been one of my most
fixed and undoubting conclusions. It is, that man is a religious
being, by the organic constitution of his frame, still
more than by any intellectual process of reasoning. I have
no doubt, that a rightly organized and well endowed man,
born and reared in a desert isle, without ever being brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
into contact with man or any discipline to call forth reason or
speech, would be subject to precisely the same emotions as,
varied and moulded by the circumstances of birth and education,
constitute the substance of all the religions in the world;
in other words, that man is constituted a religious animal in
the same way as he clearly is an animal with other instincts
and passions. I am aware, that divines and moralists do not
often insist upon the religious instinct, as one of the most
conclusive and convincing arguments (to me, at least,) of the
soul’s immortality. It seems with them the favorite view to
consider religion a science that may be taught, like geometry
or chemistry.</p>

<p>To me, this absorbing subject presents a very different
aspect. I see man everywhere religious in some form. The
sentiment takes the molding of his accidental circumstances.
It is poetry, enthusiasm, eloquence, bravery; but in every
form an aspiration after the vast, illimitable, eternal, shadowy
conceptions of an unknown hereafter, that the senses have
not embodied. It is rational or fanciful, it is respectable or
superstitious, it is a pure abstraction or a gorgeous appeal to
the senses, according to one’s country, training and temperament.
But man, whether he be a dweller in the far isles of the
sea, or in the crowded mart, whether christian or savage, is
everywhere found, in some form, invoking a God and reposing
the hopes and affections of his worn heart in another and a
better world; and extending his faith to an immortal life and
an eternal sphere of action.</p>

<p>Instead of searching for this universal principle with metaphysicians,
pronouncing upon it with dogmatists, or deducing
it from creeds, or creeds from it, I behold in it the same unwritten
revelation which we call instinct. Vague and undefined
as is this law, and questioned by some as is even its
existence, it announces to us one of the most impressive and
beautiful homilies upon the truth and goodness of the Author
of our being. It may be called the scripture of the lower
orders, guiding them, with unerring certainty, to their enjoyments
and their end. Beasts feel it, and graze the plain.
Birds feel it, and soar in the air. Fishes feel it, and dart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
along their liquid domain; each feeding, moving, resting,
playing and perpetuating its kind, according to its organic
laws. Winter comes upon the gregarious tribes of water
fowls enjoying themselves in the Canadian lakes. They
listen to this call from heaven, and mount the autumnal
winds; and without chart or compass, by a course to which
that of circumnavigators is devious, they sail to the shores of
the south, where a softer atmosphere and new supplies of
food await them. It leads the young one of these animals,
scarcely yet disengaged from the shell, to patter its bill in the
dry sand, impatiently to search for water before it has yet
seen it. It creates in the new born infant a purpose to search
for its supplies in the yet untasted fountains of the maternal
bosom. It guides all the lower orders of being through the
whole mysterious range of their peculiar habits and modes of
life. Under its influence, animals and men exercise powers
which transcend the utmost efforts of our reason. Who can
tell me why the duckling plunges into the water with the
shell on its head? Who can inform me how the affectionate
house dog, blindfolded and conveyed in utter darkness in a
carriage to a distance of fifty leagues, the moment he is emancipated,
returns by a more direct route than that by which he
came? There would be no use in presenting the most extended
details of these developments of instinct through the
whole range of animated nature. Every one knows that
wherever we discern them, either in the structure or habits
of the animal, or both, they are indications of unerring guidance,
the voice of eternal and unswerving truth, which, as
soon as promulgated, is received as the parental counsel of
the Author of nature.</p>

<p>He who could interpret the language and the gestures of
the lower orders would see in the structure and manifested
wants of fishes, that water was provided as a home for them,
had he seen them in the air. When he had noted the movements
and heard the cries of the new born infant, he would
be in no doubt, that the nutriment in the maternal bosom was
stored for it somewhere. Seeing the structure, the starting
pinions and plumage of the unfledged bird in its nest, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
could be at no loss in reasoning, that as these indications of
contrivance for other modes of life were lost in its present
manner of existence, it was intended for movements, where
pinions and plumage would avail it.</p>

<p>As certain as these instincts and indications are the pledged
verity of the Author of nature, that a sphere is provided for
the exercise of these undeveloped powers, and a corresponding
gratification for these instinctive desires, so sure as they
point out, in a language, which can neither deceive nor be
mistaken, the aim and end of the animal to which they belong,
so sure, if religion be an instinctive sentiment, and the hope,
and the persuasion of another existence result from the organic
constitution of our nature, there must be another life.
That it is so, the usages and modes of all people that have
yet been known, the people of the first ages, and the last, the
people of the highest refinement, and those, who scarcely
know the use of fire, have concurred to prove to us. Superficial
travellers, indeed, have told us of newly discovered
tribes, who had no visions of a God&mdash;a worship, or an hereafter.
Other travellers have followed them, and observed
better, and discovered, that their predecessors based the fact
on their own ignorance. They have been found to belong to
the general analogy, and to look to</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Some happier land in depth of woods embraced;</p>
<p class="verse">Some lovelier island in the watery waste.’</p>
</div></div>

<p>It seems to me, that this universal agreement of religious
ideas is the most unequivocal manifestation, that the sentiment
of religion is an instinct, that is exhibited in the whole
range of animated nature. If so, it is the offered pledge of
the divine veracity, that the soul is immortal; and that as
certain as the instinct of migrating birds is proof, that the milder
skies which they seek, exist, and are prepared for them, so
surely the undeveloped powers of the spirit, which have no
range on the earth, have a country prepared also for them.
Our aspirations, our <em>longings after immortality</em>, every mode
of worship, and every form of faith&mdash;are the rudiments, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
germs, the starting pinions of the embryo spirit, which is to
escape from its nest at death, and fly in the celestial atmosphere,
in which it was formed to move.</p>

<p>To me these universal religious manifestations are proofs,
that religion springs not, as some suppose, from tradition;
or, as others think, from reasoning. It is a sentiment. It is
an inwrought feeling in our mental constitution, an unwritten,
universal, and everlasting gospel, pointing to God and immortality.
Bring the most uninstructed peasant, who has seen
nothing of the earth, but its plains, in sight of Chimborazo.
The thrill of awe and sublimity, that springs within him at
the view, and lifts his spirit above the blue summits to the
divinity, is one of the forms, in which this sentiment acts.
The natural mental movements, in view of the illimitable main,
of the starry firmament, of elevated mountains, of whatever
is vast in dimension, irresistible in power, terrible in the exercise
of anger, in short, all those emotions, which we
call the sublime, are modified actings of the religious sentiment.
Justly has the author pronounced the universality of
these ideas the highest testimony to the elevation of human
nature. It is the most impressive and interesting attribute
of the soul, that it is subject to these impulses. It is a standing
index, that the godlike stranger, imprisoned in clay, has,
inwrought in its consciousness, indelible impressions of its
future destiny.</p>

<p>Whoever philosophically considers the constitution of the
human mind&mdash;how much we are the creatures of our circumstances,
how much we are blown about by impulse and
passion, the dimness of our own mental vision upon most
subjects, the narrow limit, which separates between
truth and falsehood, right and wrong, and moreover, that we
ourselves view everything through the coloring of our
own pride and prejudice&mdash;will perceive at once, that, under
all circumstances of error and even of crime, men are quite
as worthy of pity, as of vindictive blame. A little, cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
selfish mind invariably finds much matter for bitter censure in
every act, that, according to its own chart, is an aberration.
On the contrary, nothing, in my estimate, so decidedly marks
a generous and noble, as well as an enlightened and a philosophic
spirit, as the disposition to be indulgent in its construction
of the views and conduct of others, and to interpret all by
the comment of palliation and kindness, whenever the case
will admit of them. Great minds fail not to be conscious
what a weak, miserable compound of vanity, impulse, ignorance
and selfishness is that lord of creation, that passive
molding of circumstances, which we call man. Of course
in calmly scanning his views and conduct, all other sensations
than those of pity and kindness, die away within him. As the
human mind is exalted by its light, and its intrinsic elevation
towards the divinity, in the same proportion it soars above
the mists of its own passions and prejudices, and sees little in
humanity to inspire other feelings, than those of compassion
and benevolence. What is the view of human nature, presented
to a wise and good man?</p>

<p>I am not certain, that the real spirit of tolerance has made
so much progress in this age, as is commonly imagined. Who
among us admits in practice, as well as theory, that the mind
is passive in receiving evidence, and forming conclusions,
which it cannot shape, except according to impressions,
which it has much less power to exclude, or evade, than is generally
believed? Who among us acts on the conviction, that
errors of opinion are almost invariably involuntary? Every
view of human nature, and the laws of the human mind ought
to inspire us with an unlimited feeling of tolerance towards
those who differ from us in opinion, howsoever widely. We
cannot fail so to feel, if we reflect that, had we been in their
situation, and under their circumstances, and they in ours, our
views might have been reversed. Yet it is scarcely possible
to converse with any one a few moments, without starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
them by some opposing opinion, that jars with their excited
feelings and a certain amount of estrangement is the
result. Who can conduct a disputed point, in politics or
religion, with an unruffled temper? Angry disputation
is only another form of intolerance. If we narrowly inspect
the actings of human nature, we shall discover, that the
whole world is composed of individuals, almost every one of
whom thinks he has a right to be offended with every other
one, who does not adopt his opinions.</p>

<p>It is very true, that the age of actual persecution, by fines,
imprisonment and death, is gone by. But this results rather from
practical political progress of ideas, than from a settled conviction
that no one mind has a right to find, in the opinions of another
mind, cause of offence. Whoever cannot look upon the most
opposite faith and opinions of his neighbor, in religion, in politics,
and the ordinary concerns of life, without any feeling
of temper and bitterness, in view of that difference, is in
heart and spirit intolerant. In this view, who can justly
and fully lay claim to toleration? The whole world is divided
into millions of little parties and sects, often finding the
bitterest germs of contention in the smallest differences.
Scarcely one in ten thousand, of all these sects and parties,
has real philosophic magnanimity enough to perceive, that all
other men have as much claim for indulgence to their opinions,
as he exacts for his own.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_27" id="NOTE_27"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_27"><span class="label">Note 27, page 102.</span></a></p>

<p>It would be amusing, if such important consequences did
not flow from the error, to perceive, how much weight most
people attach to the sect and party to which the persons,
about whom they are forming an estimate, belong. The externals,
the deportment, dress and manner are often strongly
influenced by these matters; but the mental complexion or
temperament far less than is commonly supposed. We meet
with people, every day, of the most exclusive and bigoted
creeds, who act liberally: and again with people, who have
much liberality and catholicism in their mouths, and very
little in their temper and spirit. I have met with liberal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
illiberal people, in almost equal proportions, in all the sects,
parties and denominations, with which I have been acquainted.
Still, I do not, as from these remarks it might be inferred that
I do, deem error, even in abstract opinions, such as those
which appertain to religious and metaphysical subjects, as of
no consequence. But I have not time, nor have I place,
in a note, for explaining my convictions on this subject.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_27a" id="NOTE_27a"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_27a"><span class="label">Note 27a, page 104.</span></a></p>

<p>An indiscreet and exaggerating zeal often injures the cause
it would wish to serve. The gospel is best sustained by its own
unborrowed glory, and is prejudiced by adventitious appendages.
I have often heard ministers declare, from the pulpit,
that the duty of forgiveness, and of loving and doing good to
enemies was a peculiar discovery of the gospel, a precept unknown
before. We have never considered it among the objects
of the mission of our Lord, to reveal a new code of morals. The
grand eternal principles of this science were originally engraven
on the heart. Man could not have existed in society
without them. Whoever has read the elaborate and eloquent
treatises of heathen moralists, will perceive, that there
was little left incomplete in the code; and that these sublime
virtues were eulogized, as beautiful and just in theory, if not
to be expected in practice. It is the spirit, unction and tenderness
of gospel inculcation, that is unique and original. The
heathen ethical writers had not failed to enjoin it upon the
members of communities, to aid and love one another. But
it is only necessary to glance upon the apostolic epistles, to see
that Christians were a new and peculiar people, bound together
by cords of affection, altogether unknown in the previous
records of the human heart. What tenderness, what love,
<em>stronger than death</em>, what sublime disinterestedness! How
reckless to the sordid motives of ambition and interest, which
ruled the surrounding world! We scarcely need other evidence,
that this simplicity of love, so unlike aught the world
had seen before, was not an affection of earthly mold; and
that this new and strong people were not bound together by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ties, which had relation to the grossness of earthly bonds.
To me there is something inexpressibly delightful and of
which I am never weary, in contemplating the originality
and simplicity of early Christian affection, nor is it one of the
feeblest testimonies to the glory and divinity of the gospel.</p>

<p>For the rest, I have much abridged the paragraphs, to which
this note alludes, and have interpolated some expressions, not
found in the original&mdash;because I would not allow myself to
leave anything equivocal, touching my own views of the importance
of Christian morals and example.</p>

<p>It would be useless to add to the beautiful views, presented
by the author, of the disposition to oblige, and the necessity
of cultivating modesty, and an equal and serene temper. One
cannot enlarge upon these beaten topics, as he has foreseen,
without running into common-places. These virtues are
preëminently their own reward. Whoever chooses to indulge
the opposite tempers has only to reflect, that he assumes
the thankless office of becoming a self-tormentor, and
injures no one so much as himself. Of these fierce passions,
the heathen poets have given us an affecting emblem in the
undying vultures, gnawing upon the ever growing entrails of
Tityus. If you would form the sublimest conceptions of the
eternal and underived satisfaction of the divinity, cultivate
dispositions to oblige, and seize occasions to practise beneficence.
If you would image more impressive ideas of the
torment of demons than poets have dreamed, muse upon injuries;
cultivate envy and revenge, and wish that you had
the bolts of the thunderer, only that you might hurl them upon
your foes. If you would experience the eternal gnawing of
the vulture allow yourself in the constant indulgence of your
temper.</p>

<p>To those, who have already assumed this tie, or contemplate
assuming it, not a word need be said upon the most worn of
all themes, the paramount influence of marriage, beyond all
other relations, in imparting the coloring of brightness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
gloom to all subsequent life. The place, in which the
only satisfactions of life, that are worth any serious pursuit,
are to be found, is within the domestic walls. Honor, fame,
wealth, luxury, literary distinction, everything is extrinsic,
and hollow, everything the mere mockery and shadow of joy,
but the comfort of a quiet and affectionate home. Whoever
does not share this faith with me, will hardly be enlightened
to the true sources of enjoyment by any lucubrations of mine.
Instead of details and declamation upon this truth, I present
an unvarnished, unexaggerated view, an abstract, if I may so
say, of the circumstances, under which the greater number
of marriages are consummated in our country, and I imagine,
in most civilized countries. It may not embrace the exact
train of the incidents connected with every case; but will
serve, in the phrase of the makers of calendars, ‘without material
variation,’ as an outline of the history of those courtships
that terminate in matrimony. What wonder, that wedded
life is so often unhappy!</p>

<p>I am compelled to believe, that very few marriages take
place in consequence of such an intimate acquaintance of the
parties with each other’s unsophisticated and interior character,
as to justify the chances of affection and domestic happiness.
The first adverse circumstance is, that both are constantly
on such a trial to make a show of wit, good temper, and
manners, as to render the whole scene, from commencement
to close, a drama, in which all is acting; in which there is
no admission to the real life behind the scenes, until after
marriage. How often does the actor or actress, who successfully
personated a wit, and an angel, detect in the other
party a simpleton, a brute, or a termagant! The walk of life,
in which they are found, may vary the shades, but it changes
not the natural circumstances of a picture, which, in its
broader features, applies alike to elevated and humble life.</p>

<p>The parties, in the bloom of life, in all the excitement of
juvenile buoyancy, moving in the illumined atmosphere of
imagination, meet at the party, ball-room, assembly, church,
or other place of concourse, for which the young dress, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
look around, and be gazed upon. They are clad in their gayest,
and stand on their best. No airs, or graces, that mothers,
or friends, or society, or their Chesterfield, or their imaginations
can suggest, are pretermitted. No attempted inflictions
are spared from any relentings of mercy. Many gratuitous
nods and smiles and remarks, and much odious affectation, inspired
by the love of conquest, pass well enough in the
tinsel illusion of the scene and circumstances. Accident
brings the couple into contact. They sing, dance, walk, converse,
or, in some of these ways, are thrown together. Or,
perhaps, some officious mediator reports, to the one, flattering
remarks made by the other. The first impulses to the acquaintance
are those of vanity, and the instinctive attraction
of persons, so situated, towards each other. A vague and
momentary liking, which might be effaced, as easily as mists
vanish in the sun, is the result. The lady, from the delicacy
of her organization, and the quickness of her perceptions, is
the first aware of the new state of mutual feeling; and by conjoining
a happy combination of coquetry, shyness, and encouragement,
adds fuel to the kindling spark. They converse
apart, and the masonic pressure of hands is interchanged.
Compliments ensue, more or less polished, and eloquent, according
to their native readiness and artificial training. Vanity
comes in with her legion of auxiliaries, and, in the same proportion
as memory invests this intercourse with pleasant sensations
and agreeable associations, conversation with other
persons, between whom and themselves these processes have
not commenced, becomes tasteless and irksome; and ennui
in all other society does its part to put imagination in action.
They find themselves weary and sad in separation. Fancy
runs riot and begins to weave her fairy tissue, and to build her
oriental bowers. The parties are now in love, as they believe,
and as the world pronounces. Now commence the hours of
poetry and sentimentality; and the spring time of their new
born passion. Not a moment, for discriminating observation
of each other’s character, has yet occurred.</p>

<p>The freshness of the vernal inclination acquires the fervor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of settled and summer passion. The preliminaries of form
are commenced; and under such associations, and with such
mutual inclinations, incompatibility, unfitness, opposition
of friends, all obstacles that are not absolutely insurmountable,
disappear. What parent can resist the impassioned
eloquence of a child, or contemplate for a moment the
prospect of inflicting the agony of a disappointed and hopeless
love! Have they measured each other’s understanding
and good sense? No: this requires a discrimination, for which
in the fever, the delirium of the senses, they have no capacity.
Know they aught of each other’s worth and good temper?
No. Lovers find nothing to jar their temper, or try their disposition.
Surrounded by a halo of imagination, everything
about them is invested with its brilliancy. The silliest remark
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inamorata</i> sounds in the ears of the lover, like the response
of an oracle; and he is astonished and enraged that all
others do not see, and hear with him. Everything that is said
becomes wisdom, and everything done noble and graceful.
Who has not heard all these ascriptions, all these extravagant
eulogies, applied to a fair female, uttering nothing, and
incapable of uttering anything, but voluble and vapid nonsense;
or worse, ebullitions of envy, detraction and bad
feeling! Meanwhile, the parties, enveloped in illusion, would
not see real character, if they could; and could not, if they
would. Is this extravagant, or exaggerated? Let the well
known fact, that sensible men oftener marry fools, and gifted
women coxcombs, than otherwise, be received as evidence,
that this great transaction is generally commenced,
and terminated under a spell, in which the actors see nothing,
as it really is, and as it appears to disinterested spectators.
After having united many hundred pairs myself, and seen all
aspects of society, such seem to me the most common circumstances
appended to the beginning, progress and issue of
courtship, in its common forms.</p>

<p>When ambitious views, the lust of wealth, and purposes of
aggrandizement, are the prompting incitements, the order of
circumstances indeed may be essentially varied, without much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
altering the result. The excitement of the senses and the
illusions of the imagination give place to these more sordid
motives. They are, however, equally absorbing with the
former. The faculties, having converged to the point of
cautious and keen speculation, allow no greater scope, and
furnish no happier facilities, for noting the development of
understanding, character and temper, than in the other
predicament. The appetite for money, and the burning of
ambition may as effectually blind the aspirant to the silliness
and bad temper of her who is seen through the flattering
medium of his plans and his hopes, as could his vanity and
his youthful inclinations. How can a person be expected to
compare, and discriminate traits, and the almost imperceptible
lights and shades of character, whose whole mind is intensely
concentrated on the chances of his speculation, the
fear of rivals, the danger of mishap, and the means of hastening
the issue? Who, under such circumstances, inquires
about the elements of happiness or misery, the good sense,
the regulated temper, the discretion, health, temperament,
and habits, that appertain to the means, by which a fortune
and a name are to be obtained? These are passed by, as
subordinate considerations. Suppose inquiries touching these
points to glance through the mind. Suppose the speculator to
have lucid glimpses, and some startling premonitions of the
importance of settled and discriminating views, in relation
to these matters; contemplated through golden associations
and in the glare of ambitious hopes, they will be hardly
likely to undergo a very severe or sifting scrutiny.</p>

<p>The marriage, whether of love, of ambition, of convenience
or mere animal impulse, takes place. The music and dancing
are no more, and the brilliancy of the bridal torch is extinct,
and with those physical <em>parapharnalia</em>, one mental illusion after
another begins to melt into thin air. The discriminating
faculties, judgment and the critical vision, now become morbidly
sensitive and severe, since satiety and the extinction of
fancy and the imagination have left these capacities to unchecked
action, beholding the object of their scrutiny continually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and close at hand. The medium becomes as unnaturally
dark, as it was unnaturally light before. A thousand
circumstances, never dreamed of in the philosophy of love
and courtship, crowd upon this disposition to cynical and
bilious criticism. Manifestations of temper and character,
that once indicated to the lover, amiability and intelligence,
become, to the moody husband or the discontented
wife, marks of a weak understanding and a bad heart; and
in proportion, as they nourish despondency and disappointment,
they destroy the capability of indulgence and forbearance,
and resist efforts to soothe, and correct, and conciliate.</p>

<p>In proportion as they become dissatisfied with each other,
by a mental progress, exactly the reverse of that which
brought them together, home is enveloped with associations of
gloom. The imagination finds sunshine in every other place;
and every other person is sensible and attractive, but the one
they have sworn to love and honor until death.</p>

<p>There are those who will see in these revolting representations,
a coloring of misanthropy; and pronounce this statement
of the case harsh beyond nature. I would it were so;
for, unless I deceive myself, I love my kind; and my only
object is, to impress upon the young the importance of inquiring,
when contemplating this vital and all important transaction,
whether they see things in the clear light of truth, and
as they will certainly appear after the delirium of love has
passed away; or under the nameless and numberless illusions
of that fever of the senses, of vanity, and instinct, too often
miscalled by the name of love. I much mistake, if the greater
portion of the domestic infelicity, which is loudly charged
upon the wedded state in the abstract, is not owing to this
fascination, this incapacity to examine the only elements, on
which the happiness of a family must depend. All I would
say, is, before entering on this union, remember, that it is
easier to repent before, than after the evil is without a
remedy. Pause and scrutinize; and let not the first glimpse
of real light open your eyes to your true condition, when it is
irretrievable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>I am as well aware, as the author can be, that there are
many more happy marriages, than vulgar opinion allows, and
that even in those, which are not reputed happy, in which the
parties themselves have had their criminating and complaining
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissements</i>, there is often much more affection, than
has been allowed to exist. Such is generally found to be
the case, in the numberless attempted separations, which
prove abortive, when the final alternative is to be adopted. I
know, too, that the history of the manifestation of conjugal
affection is one of the most affecting and honorable to human
nature, that has ever been exhibited. No union of tenderness
and fortitude has ever been displayed in the annals of
human nature, that can be compared with the maternal love and
conjugal affection of a devoted wife. Of this, if I had space,
and my scope were different, I could cite numerous, and
most impressive examples.</p>

<p>I beg leave to enter my utter dissent to this doctrine. It
seems from a note appended to this chapter of the author, that
dislike to female authorship has been carried to the most
ridiculous lengths in France. This is the more astonishing,
as no country has produced so many admirable female writers,
many of them peculiarly noted for possessing the charm of
simplicity, and freedom from pedantry and affectation. A
woman, not less than a man, is more amiable, interesting and
capable of sustaining any relation with honor and dignity, in
proportion as she is more instructed and enlightened. It is
to female pedants only, that the ridiculous question of the
French academy, whether a reputable woman could write
a book, ought to apply. If a woman really deserves a
crown of laurels, it sits more gracefully on her brow, than
any chaplet of roses that poet ever dreamed of. But let us
have real, unpresuming knowledge, without pedantry or
affectation, either of which is always odious in man or
woman, but certainly, as it seems to me, most so in woman.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, is more common, than this contemptible
ambition of wives to govern their husbands. It is said
that there are coteries of wives, who impart the rules in
masonic conclave. Be it so. Whoever exults in having
usurped this empire, glories in her shame. If there be any
axiom universally applying to this partnership, it is, that
the interest and reputation of the concern must be identical.
However much a wife may humble her husband, in
general estimation, by presenting him in the light of a weak
and docile subject, with all sensible persons, she humbles herself
still more. If the slave is contemptible, the tyrant is
still more so. For the rest, this chapter contains more truth
and impressive eloquence upon this all important theme, than
I have elsewhere met in so small a compass.</p>

<p>I present you with the following development of these new
emotions, which, I hope, you will not find amiss. ‘William
and Yensi were as happy in this vale, as man can hope to be
here below. They would have requested nothing more of
heaven, than thousands of years of this half dreaming, yet
satisfying existence. A daughter was born to them, a desert
flower of exquisite beauty even from its birth. New and
unmoved fountains of slumbering and mysterious affections
were awakened in the deepest sanctuary of their hearts. In
the clear waters of the brook, which chafed over pebbles,
turfed with wild sage and numberless desert flowers, under the
overhanging pines, in the tops of which the southern breeze
played the grand cathedral service of the mountain solitudes,
William performed, as priest, father and Christian, the touching
ceremony of baptizing his babe. Adding the name Jessy to that
of the mother, it was called Jessy Yensi. The sacred rite
was performed on the sabbath, as the sun was sinking in
cloud-curtained majesty behind the western mountains. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
domestics, Ellswatta and Josepha, looked on with awe. William
read the Scriptures, prayed, and sang a hymn; baptized
his babe, and handed the nursling of the desert to Yensi. As
she received the beloved infant in her arms, after it had been
consecrated, as an inmate in the family of the Redeemer,
while tears of tenderness and piety filled her eyes and fell
from her cheeks, she declared, that she would no longer invoke
the universal Tien, that the God of William and her
babe should be her God, and that they would both call on the
same name, when they prayed together for the dear babe even
unto death.’&mdash;<cite>Shoshonee Valley</cite>, vol. i. p. 52, 53.</p>

<p>Of the emotions excited by all the incidents between the
cradle and the grave, none can be compared for depth and
tenderness to those, called forth by the birth and baptism of
the first child of an affectionate and happy husband and wife.
Those, for whom this work is more peculiarly intended, will
be aware, to what incident in our common stock of remembrances
the above extract refers. Delightful sentiments, and
yet deeply tinged with sadness! What a mystery is this
conjoined miniature image of the parents, the babe itself!
What a mystery the world with its mingled lights and shadows,
upon which the feeble stranger is entering! What a mystery
the unknown bourne to which it is bound! What a mystery
the God, to whom it is consecrated! Callous and cold
must be the heart of parents, that this mutual pledge of love
and duty will not unite in one unchangeable sentiment of love
and identity of interest, until death.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_33" id="NOTE_33"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_33"><span class="label">Note 33, page 122.</span></a></p>

<p>My views touching the modes, in which the best results
of education are to be obtained, whether just or erroneous,
have at least the advantage of being entirely practical. I am
sufficiently convinced, that there must be an adequate and
happy organization and mental development, without which
no education, however wise and assiduous, will ever effect
anything more, than mediocrity of character and acquirement.
In the present state of public opinion, as great mistakes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
made by expecting too much from the training of schools, as
were formerly committed by attempting too little. The opulent,
and people in the higher walks especially, are tempted
by their condition to believe, that wealth and distinction can
purchase, and even command mind, and that cultivation of it, by
which more enlarged and distinguished minds differ from the
common measure of intellect; a mistake, than which no other
is more universally, and palpably taught by every day’s experience.
The Author of our being reserves, and will never
impart his own high prerogative, to bestow mind; and he as often
dispenses the noblest and richest endowment of it in the
lower, as in the upper walks of life; though, as we have seen,
he has indicated, in the order of nature, a process of unlimited
improvement of organization and endowment.</p>

<p>But the substratum of a practical and well endowed mind,
to begin with, being granted, I beg leave to add my conviction
to that of M. Droz, a conviction, which, as I think, will
resume its authority and influence, when most of the present
tedious and endless systems and projects of education will
have passed into their merited oblivion. It is, that strong,
latent and distinguished character and acquirement receive
in domestic education, that predominant and fashioning direction,
which they retain through life. The peculiar impress
of a parent, a family-friend, a single tutor, is often as distinctly
marked upon the whole after life of the scholar, that becomes
truly distinguished, as though he had been wax in the hands
of a moulder. The numerous tutors of opulent families, and of
public institutions, seldom impart the same advantage. Their
different views and modes of discipline countervail, and neutralize
each other. The Greeks and the great Romans taught
at home, the master being a member and an honored one of
the family. The master and the pupil walked, conversed,
and pursued their amusements together; and the sweet associations
of home and the shade and freedom from restraint
were conjoined with the lessons. When the good Plutarch
paints to us, with his inimitable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naiveté</i>, one of his favorite
characters, he indicates as his first felicity, that it was his lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to have the training of an Aristotle, or some similar worthy.
Consult the English Plutarch for the same fact. Could all the
commencing circumstances of most of the great men, who
have lived, be exactly traced, we should find the same truth
disclosed. That the development of strong inclination for
books, studies and literature depends almost entirely on domestic
habits and pursuits, the family, in which <em>our</em> common
remembrances centre, is a striking example. During the
years, in which the minds of this family received their unchangeable
impress, the members were almost as vagrant in
their modes, as the Tartars. All their education, except domestic,
was exceedingly imperfect and desultory. Books were
often wanting; adequate teachers always. But the love of
the parents for books and reading was a simple, natural, unaffected
and intense impulse. They loved the thing for its
own sake, and independent of all its results. The first instruments
of pleasure, and things of estimated value, that
greeted the infant eyes of the children, were books; not
furniture, dress, and the imposing ostentation of a modern
parlor. Pleasant conversations, disputes, between laughter
and seriousness, about these books, were the first conversations
that greeted their listening ears. These conversations
were perceived to be of deep and heart-felt interest, and as
little mixed with pedantry and formality, as the manifestations
of instinct. The children saw, that to those, they most loved,
admired, and were disposed to imitate, books were the grand
sources of interest, converse and enjoyment. They as naturally
imbibed similar tastes, as, to use a coarse illustration,
the children of savages learn to love hunting. The first thing
for which they contended, and with which they wished to play,
was a book, or a picture. Their first lispings were trials of
skill, touching the comparative progress, which they had made
in their knowledge of the contents of these books, and the
application of it to present use. These trials they saw to be
the chief points of interest and amusement for their parents.
Thus, habits of reading and application <em>grew with their growth
and strengthened with their strength</em>; and many a criticism, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
not erudite and profound, at least eliciting hearty praise and
laughter, passed away unrecorded in their domestic privacy.
Their neighbors admired, and, I fear, envied, and calumniated;
but could not but take astonished note of such results in a
family without wealth, without the common appliances, which
themselves could so much better afford, and which they had
been accustomed to consider the only price, at which intellectual
improvement could be purchased. It was placed beyond
question, or denial, that the members of that family had right
views, quiet and unawed self-respect, and could converse rationally,
upon every other topic, as well as books; that tact
and discrimination pervaded their manifestations of thought
and pursuit; and that they possessed an inexhaustible source
of amusement, and satisfaction independent of wealth, fashion,
society, distinction, or any external resource whatever&mdash;the
habit of internal reflection, comparison and pleasant converse
with themselves.</p>

<p>Parents, when you have imparted to your children habits
and tastes, like these, you have bequeathed them an intellectual
fortune, which few changes can take away; and which
is as strictly independent, as anything earthly can be. You
have unlocked to their gratuitous use perennial fountains of
innocent and improving enjoyment. You have secured them
forever against the heart-wearing gloom of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>, insufficiency
to themselves, and slavish dependence upon others for amusement.
Spend as lavishly as you may, in multiplying fashionable
instructers, and blazon, as much as you will, the advantages
of your children; if they do not perceive, while the
rudiments of their taste and habits are forming, that you
consider literature, science and the improvement of intellect
a matter of paramount interest and importance, you will never
cause their stream to flow higher, than your fountain. An
occasional parlor lecture, or a high wrought eulogy, will not
convince them, or avail to your purpose. They must see this
preference, as all others, which they will be inclined to copy,
manifested in your whole deportment and conversation.</p>

<p>But, while I am convinced, that parents will find efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
train their children to be highly intellectual, rowing against
the current, unless they evince, themselves, by their habitual
examples, that they consider it a higher attainment, to possess
literature and conversational powers, than fashion, or wealth
or the common objects of pursuit, in other words, that all
efficient education must be essentially domestic, I would
not be understood to undervalue public schools and colleges.
I am aware, that in these places are best imparted the knowledge
and adroitness that fit them for the keen scramble of ambitious
competition. But in regard to those boys who leave
their competitions behind the classes of the university, I
think on examination, we shall find, that the germ and the
stamina of this progress were early communicated by instruction
and example at home. At table, around the evening fire,
in the Sabbath walk, in the common family intercourse, in
the intervals of the toil of your profession, whatever it be,
the taste and the permanent inclination for literature and intellectual
cultivation are imparted. This can never be, if behind
all your eulogy of these things, you discover, that
your ruling passion is money, or the sordid objects of common
pursuit.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_34" id="NOTE_34"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_34"><span class="label">Note 34, page 124.</span></a></p>

<p>It is a common and, I much fear, a well founded complaint,
that some latent mischief in our system of education, political
institutions, the ordering of our establishments, or
in all these together, has generated, as a prevalent moral
evil, filial unkindness and ingratitude. Scramble, competition
and rivalry are the first, last, and universally witnessed order
of things in our country. Nothing becomes a topic of conversation
that is of absorbing interest, but acquisition and distinction.
The manifestations of an intellect, sharpened for
the pursuit of these things, is the subject of most earnest
eulogy. Children, by our usages, are early cast upon their
own resources, and taught to shift for themselves. The consequence
seems to be, that the parental and filial ties are
severed, as soon as the children are able to take care of themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
almost as recklessly, in regard to subsequent duty, piety
or affection, as those of the lower animals. When we see a
spectacle so revolting, and unhappily so common, of sons who,
as soon as they have realized <em>the portion of goods that falleth
to them</em>, or of daughters, as soon as they have secured lovers
or husbands, forgetting the authors of their days, it becomes
us to search deeply for the defect in our discipline, or institutions,
that originates the evil. The callous hearts of such
children may no longer be appalled by the terrible execution
of the Jewish law against such monsters. They may neither
feel, nor care, how <em>sharper than a serpent’s tooth</em>, may be this
want of filial piety to their parents. But, by a righteous reaction
of the divine justice, more terribly vindictive than the
threatened judgment of the Jewish law, thankless children
bear in their hearts the certain guaranty of their own self-inflicted
punishment. They part forever with the purest and
noblest sentiments of the human heart; and they procure
for themselves the sad certainty of being cast off in their
turn, by their children, in the helpless period of their old age.</p>

<p>The history of literature proves, that none of the more unworthy
sentiments of human nature have been so adverse to
friendship, as the vanity of literary rivals. From many
noble examples of a contrary kind, which we might cite, I
select the intercourse between Racine and Boileau. When
Racine was persuaded, that his malady would end in death,
he charged his eldest son to write to M. de Cavoye, to ask
him to solicit the payment of what was due of his pension,
that his family might not be left without ready money. He
wrote the letter and read it to his father. ‘Why did you not,’
said he, ‘request the payment of the pension of Boileau at
the same time? Write again, and let him know, that I was
his friend in death.’ This friend came to receive his last
adieu. Racine rose in bed, as far as his weakness would
allow. As he embraced his friend, he said ‘I regard it a
happiness to die in your presence.’</p>

<p>The celebrated Voiture, one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> of the
age of Louis XIII. had lost all his money, and had an immediate
call for 200 pistoles. He wrote to the Abbe Costar, his
faithful friend. This admirable letter presents us with a trait
of that confidence and frankness, which sincere friendship
inspires. It was this.</p>

<p>‘I yesterday lost all my money, and 200 pistoles more, which
I have promised to pay today. If you have that sum, do not
fail to send it. If not, borrow it. Obtain it, as you may,
you must lend it me. Be careful, to allow no one to anticipate
you, in giving me this pleasure. I should be concerned
lest it might affect my love for you. I know you so well,
that I am aware, you would find it difficult to console yourself.
To avoid this misfortune, rather sell what will raise it.
You see how imperious my love for you is. I take a pleasure
in conducting in this manner towards you. I feel, that
I should have a still greater, if you would be as frank with
me. But you have not my courage in this point. Judge, if I
am not perfectly assured in regard to you, since I will give my
promise to him, who shall bring the money.’ The Abbe Costar
replied&mdash;‘I feel extreme joy, to be in condition to render you
the trifling service, you ask of me. I had never thought, that
one could purchase so much pleasure for 200 pistoles. Having
experienced it, I give you my word, that, for the rest of my
life, I will retain a little capital, always ready for your occasions.
Order confidently at your pleasure. You cannot take
half the satisfaction in commanding, that I shall in obeying.
But submissive as you may find me in other respects, I shall
be revolted, if you wish to compel me to take a promise
from you.’</p>

<p>Although I do not intend to cite in this place the story of
Damon and Pythias, nor to harp upon discussions of a theme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
upon which there has been more odious prosing, and more
semblance of sentiment than all others, yet a subject, intrinsically
of the first importance, and founded in nature, can
never cease to have claims upon attention, in consequence of
having been hackneyed to thread-bare triteness. There is
such an affection, as friendship. It belongs to man, and is the
highest honor of his nature, less gross and terrene, than the
short epilepsy, the transient and fitful fever of the senses,
commonly dignified with the name of love, and warmer, more
exhilarating, and elevated, than mere esteem, and common
liking; it excites, without inflaming; it thrills, without
jealousy, corroding fear, or morbid solicitude. It is that sentiment,
which a poet would naturally assign to intellectual
beings of a higher order, who were never invested with the
corporeal elements of mortality.</p>

<p>I wish those, most dear to me, implicitly to believe in friendship.
I would a thousand times prefer, that they should err
on the side of credulity, than of suspicion and distrust. I deprecate,
above all things, that they should give up human
nature. I consider real misanthropy the last misfortune. I
would, rather, my children should meet with treachery and
inconstancy every day of their lives, than resign themselves
to the morbid and heartless persuasion, weakly considered an
attribute of wisdom and greatness, that men are altogether
selfish, and unworthy of confidence. It is a persuasion, that
not only forever invests the universe in an Egyptian gloom,
‘<em>that may be felt</em>,’ but, by an energetic bearing on all the
faculties and sources of feeling, causes the heart, that entertains
such views to become what it believes to be the
character of the species.</p>

<p>No scruples of false decorum shall withhold me from saying,
that, amidst all the selfishness, which optics of the most
charitable vision could not but discover on every side, I have
seen friendship, pure, holy, disinterested, like that of the
angels; nay, more&mdash;have been myself the subject of it.
My heart swells, and will to its latest pulsation, with the
remembered proofs. True, the instances, that have fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
within the compass of my experience, are very few. But
they are sufficient to settle my conviction, that the sentiment,
which has inspired the enthusiasm of eloquence, painting
and song, in all time, is not the illusion of a weak and
misguided imagination. Selfish as man is, we often see instances
of the most generous and devoted friendship, even
in this silver age, the age of revenue and political economy.</p>

<p>With my author I believe, that where the sentiment exists
between a man and a woman, admitting each to possess
the estimable endowments peculiar to each sex, and so exists,
as not to be modified by any of those countless associations
of another order of sentiment, that almost imperceptibly
invest relations between the two sexes, it is more vivid,
permanent and disinterested, more capable of making sacrifices,
and more tender and delightful than it can be between persons
of the same sex. Of this class are the most noble, touching
and sublime examples of a constancy under every form
of proof, that the history of the human heart records.</p>

<p>While every one is sensible, that there must exist
between characters, that are susceptible of all the fidelity
and beauty of this sentiment, a certain adaptation of
circumstances, and conformity of disposition, mind, development
and temperament, I believe with St Pierre, that it is
desirable, that there should be a certain contrast as well as
much fitness. Constant assentation, the same opinions, tastes,
tempers and views have been found by experience, not to generate
the most permanent, and pleasant unions of the sort.
The moral, as well as the physical appetite, would grow
weary of perpetual uniformity and unvarying similarity, and
requires the spice, afforded by the mixture of various ingredients
of affectionate contrariety. Both the love and friendship,
most likely to endure, spring up between the placid and
piquant, the tranquil and energetic, the monotonously sweet
tempered and the sensitive, whose irritability is held in
check by good sense, kindness and self-control;&mdash;between
the temperament, connected with blue eyes and fair hair,
and that of the keen, deep black eye, and raven locks. ‘Soldiers,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
says St Pierre, ‘on long and distant expeditions,
should be associated with ministers, lawyers with naturalists,
and in general, the strongest contrasts of profession’&mdash;<em>all
nature’s discord thus making all nature’s peace</em>. But I am
perfectly aware, that there will be great danger of making
fatal mistakes, in acting on this principle. I am confident,
that is true in the abstract; but let sentimentalists beware of
trenching too confidently on ground, where the limits between
safety and ruin are so narrow, and difficult to discern. Doves
of a different feather may pair happily, but not doves and vultures.
There must be a certain compatibility not only of character,
but of age, condition and circumstances, as we are
broadly instructed in the fable of the frog thinking to wed
with the ox.</p>

<p>Any discussion of the details, touching the requisite circumstances
of compatibility to form friendships with any chance of
their being pleasant and permanent, as well as the obligations
and duties involved by it, would require a volume, and would
carry me utterly beyond my present purpose. Books are ample,
if not interesting and just, in the information which they impart
upon this subject. With my views of its obligations and
duties in few words, I shall dismiss it.</p>

<p>In a pecuniary point of view the claims of friendship are
only limited by the sterner demands of justice. The
common adage, which calls upon us to be just, before we allow
ourselves to be generous, is worthy to be written
in letters of gold; though it has been a thousand times wrested
by selfish and cold hearts, into a pretext for their avarice.
Whoever should think of lavishing his money upon a friend,
in order to absolve himself from the more difficult calls of
justice, would show a mind, too weak and incapable of discrimination,
to honor that friend by his bounty. But, grant
that the friends have delicacy, consideration and gentlemanly
tact, and they may possess a common purse, without danger
to the duties of either.</p>

<p>The fame and character of the one are strictly the property
of the other. Let no one, who has the least particle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the base alloy of envy in his feelings towards him, whom he calls
his friend, who is willing to hear, and countenance abatements
of his qualities, talents, or virtues, dare to assume that
almost sacred name. He is equally unworthy of it, if he
stand by in neutrality when calumny is busily passing against
him; and still more, if by smiles he gives his countenance,
and half his consent to the story of detraction and abatement.
It is a forfeiture of the right to the name, though it
may be a less worthy one, to make the person, called
friend, the subject of jest and ridicule. In regard to all these
points, the duties are clear, distinct, palpable and not to be
compromised. Every honorable mind feels, in witnessing any
infraction of the laws of equity, or strict justice, a sentiment of
recoil and disgust, difficult perhaps to define, but one which
instantly designates the person guilty of it, as unworthy of
the name of friend. Honest, frank and disinterested advice,
especially in relation to concerns of great interest to
the party, is a paramount obligation, whether the advised
will bear, or forbear. This prerogative may, indeed, be
claimed by unfeeling and rude bluntness. But, by a discriminating
mind, the suggestions of a counterfeit, will never be
mistaken for those of genuine friendship.</p>

<p>The time, the courtesy and the amount of intercourse, due
from one friend to another, can never be brought under subjection
to rules. Moral, like physical attraction, acting unconsciously,
will regulate this portion of duty, with the unvarying
certainty of the laws of nature. If persons, claiming to
sustain this relation to each other, do not wish to be as much
together, as duty and propriety will admit; if they allow this
matter to be settled by the rigid tithing of etiquette, they are
anything rather than real friends.</p>

<p>I have been struck by an incident in the life of a religious
woman, I think it was Mrs Graham. There was a sacramental
pledge between her and a friend, that, whichever of them
should be first called from life, the other should visit her in the
sickness, which she should consider her last, and not leave
her, until she had received her last sigh. Sublime test of affection!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
What a tender, sacred office, after a life of friendship,
thus, by a sacramental contract, to close the eyes of the friend
beloved in life, and separated only by death! There can be no
doubt that the feelings, called thus into action, are peculiarly
fitted to mitigate the last sorrows; and in the simple grandeur
of such a sentiment, so manifested, the departing friend will see
a proof, that such affections are, in their own nature, immortal;
and that such ties shall be renewed in the eternal regions
of the living.</p>

<p>When friends are separated wide from each other by distance,
duty, and the stern calls of our pursuits, I admire the
custom of baptizing, if I may so say, our remembrances, by
giving the names of our dear and distant friends to the hills,
valleys, streams, trees or pleasant views in our walks; or the
objects most familiar and pleasant to our view. The stern
silence of nature may thus be compelled to find a tongue,
and discourse with us of those we love.</p>

<p>In a word, the name, I am sensible, is too often a morbid
mockery of cold and affected sentimentalism, both weak and
disgusting, the cant term for the intercourse between the
enlarged prisoners of boarding schools. But the sentiment
exists, pure, simple delightful. Neither fawning, nor cant, nor
flattery, nor any mixture of earth’s mould makes any part of it.
Honorable, dignified, unshaken, it feels its obligations, and
discharges them. The reputation, character and whole interest
of the friend is its object; and his highest happiness
its prayer. In holy segregation from the hollow intercourse,
false phrases and deceitful compliments of fashion, and
what is called the world, it is faithful and consistent, under
all proofs and trials, until death; and when the eyes of the
departed are closed, his memory is enshrined in the remembrance
of the survivor. Thank God! I have seen, I have
felt, that there are such friendships; and if there is anything
honorable, dignified and attractive in aught, that earth presents,
it is the sight of two friends, whose attachment dates
from their first remembered sentiment; and has survived difference
of opinion and interest, the changes of distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
time and disease, and those weaning influences, which, while
they crumble the most durable monuments, convert most hearts
to stone.</p>

<p>I have long been in the habit of measuring the character,
mental power and prospects of the young, who are brought
by circumstances under my observation, by the power which
they evince, to resist the suggestion of the senses. In the
same proportion, as I see them capable of rising above the
thraldom of their appetites, capable of that energy of will,
that gives the intellectual control over the animal nature, I
graduate them higher in the scale of moral power and prospect.
But if, in their course, they manifest the clear preponderance
of the animal; if sloth, sensuality, and the inclinations, which
have no higher origin than the senses, sway them beyond the
influence of advice and moral suasion, be they ever so beautiful,
endowed, rich, distinguished, be their place in general
estimation ever so high, I put them down, as belonging to
the animal, and not the intellectual orders. They can never
reach higher worth and success, than that, which is the blind
award of accident.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that writers on taste have not seen all the
importance of uniting physical with moral ideas, to give them
any deep and permanent interest. This subject might be enlarged
to any extent, by carrying out the details, suggested
by the striking, just, but necessarily very brief views of
the author. We have here a clue, by which we may explore
a whole universe of the highest and purest pleasures which
can touch the heart, and which to the greater portion of the
species have no existence.</p>

<p>There are travellers more learned, and equally capable of
noting facts with M. de Chateaubriand. They have traversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the same countries, seen the same objects, and collected
an immense mass of facts, which they have published, on
their return, to be read by none, but kindred spirits, as dull
as themselves. In his record of his travels in the same countries,
we are beguiled onward, under the spell of a sustained
charm. The imagination is constantly in action; the heart
swells; images of grandeur and beauty, remembrances of
pathos and power are evoked from every side, and the shadows
of the past throng round us. Why is it so? The former
see brute nature, in its lifeless and motionless materiality,
divorced from mind and memory. The latter not only sees
that universe with a radiant eye, but holds converse with a
superincumbent universe, as much more vast, beautiful, touching,
diversified, than the other, as mind is superior to matter.
It is this creation of thoughts, remembrances, poetry, and affecting
images, in his mind, intimately connected with the
other, and overshadowing it, like an illumined stratum over a
region covered with palpable mist, by virtue of which he
makes nature eloquent. This is the charm spread over all
the beautiful passages that abound in his writings; a peculiar
aptitude to associate nature, in every position and form, with
the universe of thought within him. Such is the endowment
of all poets, orators, and painters, that have produced efforts
worthy of immortality. Common writers see nature dead, silent,
sterile&mdash;mere brute and voiceless matter. Endowed
minds kindle it into speech, beauty and grandeur; interpreting
it by the internal world in their own minds.</p>

<p>These illustrations of the importance of uniting moral with
physical ideas, in regard to vision, landscape, painting and
music, are as true, as they are eloquent and striking. Who
has not had the vivid remembrance of home recalled in a distant
land, by a tree, a feature in the landscape, a blue hill
in the distance! How readily the shadowy images of memory
are evoked! Every one is acquainted with the touching circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in the character of the Swiss soldiers serving in foreign
countries. Great numbers of them used to serve, as stipendaries,
in the French armies. It was forbidden to play,
in their presence, the air <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ranz des vaches</i>. Homesickness
and desertion scarcely failed to ensue from hearing it. The
wild and plaintive air reminded them of ‘Sweet home,’ their
mountains, their simple pleasures, and the range and lowing
of their kine. The beautiful Scotch airs derive their charm
from their association with mountain scenery, and the peculiar
history and manners of a highly sensitive, intelligent and
national people. The same may be said of the unrivalled
<em>Erin go Bragh</em>, in relation to the Irish; in a word of the national
music of every people. Associate any idea with sentiment
and the heart, and it becomes touching, and sublime,
and capable of stirring the deepest fountains of feeling,
according to the remembrance with which it is allied.</p>

<p>I have heard persons, endowed with keen feelings, repiningly
contrast the miseries which they endured from
an excess of irritable and unregulated sensibility, with the
apparently joyous apathy of fat and fortunate burghers, who
seem to find no sorrows and no troubles in life, and who
hear with incredulity and, in fact, with an entire want of comprehension,
about sufferings resulting from witnessing misery,
which we have no means of relieving, and the sorrows, from
innumerable sources, to which those of a keenly sensitive nature
are subject. I have never seen these contrasts of character
in this light. I unhesitatingly believe that a righteous
Providence has exactly and admirably adjusted the weights
in either scale. The great mass, who are not disturbed with
excess of feeling, are, from the same temperament, interdicted
from a whole universe of enjoyments, into which
those, who possess sensibility, and regulate it aright, have
free access.</p>

<p>Man seems to contain, according as he is contemplated
in different lights, inexplicable contradictions of character;
and to be at one time all tenderness of heart; and at another
an odious compound of insensibility and cruelty; according to
the circumstances with which he is surrounded, and the positions
in which he is placed. Who could believe, that it
was the same being, that now dissolves into tears at the rehearsal
of a tragedy, on reading a romance or witnessing a
spectacle of misery, and now hurries from these emotions to
see a bull-fight; and in passing to the show, encourages two
bullies in the street to form a ring, to bruise each other!
Who would believe, that it has always been considered an
attribute in the more susceptible sex, to regard duellists with
a partial eye; to give a secret place in their kind feelings to
those who are reckless of their own and another’s blood; and
more than all to look propitiously on soldiers encrimsoned
with the fresh stains of the battle field? Nay, more, who
reads without astonishment, and almost without unbelief, that
a whole people, in the days of the pagan Roman emperors,
days of the utmost luxury of taste and refinement, days, in
which, in all probability, traits of kindness, generosity and
magnanimity were no more uncommon than now, the ladies
of the greatest and most splendid city in the world thronged
with an irrepressible curiosity, and an intense desire, to see
naked gladiators lacerate, and stab each other, and old
and feeble men torn in pieces by lions and wild beasts,
when merely a movement of a finger would save them!</p>

<p>The ministers of the gospel, who attribute the abhorrence,
which the same spectacles would excite in the population of
a Christian city, to the humanizing influences of our faith,
forget that such a city has seen, times without number, its
inhabitants pouring forth from its gates, to witness miserable

at the spectacle.</p>

<p>Protestant ministers exult, in contrasting the influences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the reformed faith with results like these; and yet witness
their congregations thronging in crowds to see a wretched
criminal swinging in the agonies of strangulation. The
same people thrill with horror, as they hear, around their
evening fire, how those whom they call savages, dance, and
yell round the stake, at which a captive enemy is burning.
To the red man it seems the extreme of cold-blooded
ferocity, to execute a criminal with a halter, by the hands
of a person who bears no ill will to the victim.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to question one of the sublime trophies
of the gospel, or to doubt its refining and humanizing influences.
But the whole aspect of history and society compels
me to believe, that fashion and prevalent opinions exert
an influence, that will bring men to tolerate almost anything.
I much fear, that the spectacles of the Roman Amphitheatre
might be revived, if a certain number of any community
would pertinaciously conspire, to write in favor of them, and
countenance them by their presence.</p>

<p>To present, in contrast, the favorable side of human contradictions:&mdash;I
have seen a man plunge into the water, and put
his own life at fearful jeopardy, to rescue a stranger from
drowning. I have witnessed instances of disinterested and
heroic sacrifice, which present men in the aspect of angels,
in every walk of life. Such sublime samples of the capability of
our nature are the appropriate theme of oratory, painting and
song; and cannot be too much blazoned. Pity it is that history
did not select more instances, and dwell upon them with
more partial eulogy, instead of amplifying the revolting details
of war.</p>

<p>Two instances of affecting manifestation of tenderness
are deeply impressed upon my memory, simply because they
were elicited by common cases of suffering; and had in them
nothing of romance, or of uncommon tendency to excite
the feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>I was passing in the streets of one of our northern cities.
On the marble door steps of a sumptuous mansion sat a ragged
boy, with a look at once dogged and subdued, manifesting
long acquaintance with sorrow and want. Near him sat
an aged woman, apparently his mother, decrepit, worn and
squalid, with her face turned from me. The boy was devouring
with voracious greediness a piece of dried herring.
Fair and richly dressed children were passing to their morning
school. Most of them jeered him, in passing, calling
on him to get down from the steps, and asking him if he was
very hungry? ‘Yes, and you would be hungry, and sad too,
if you was poor and a stranger, and had to take care of an
old mother, and had walked as far as I have.’ One of the
boys lingered behind, as if ashamed of his feelings. I noticed
his broad, high forehead, and eye speaking a soul within.
His eyes filled with tears, as he handed the boy money. My
own eyes moistened, as I witnessed the angelic expression of
this noble boy, who I dare affirm, had not the spirit to do such
things by halves.</p>

<p>The other was in another extremity of our country,
where money and cotton, sugar and slaves, balls and
theatres are the all-absorbing objects of interest. A large
group of gaily dressed gentlemen and ladies were promenading,
in company with an heiress and her intended husband,
who were shortly to be married, and they were merely
discussing the preparations. A poor, pale boy, apparently a
stranger, came up to them, with his written petition for
charity; and with the low and subdued tone of voice appropriate
to shame, bashfulness and misery, began to tell his little
story. The splendid laughers walked on with an incurious
carelessness. One of the group lingered behind. He was
struggling with the difficulties of obtaining a profession, and
aiding in the support of a distant family. But, he bestowed
on the boy one of his few remaining dollars. When I see
such instances of native tenderness of heart, I thank God
that men are not totally depraved.</p>

<p>Every one who has had extensive acquaintances, and been
exposed to frequent requests for letters of recommendation, and
to procure the intervention and aid of opulent friends, must
feel the importance and justice of these remarks. We ought
not to refuse such letters from indolence, selfishness, or the
commonly alleged fear of troubling our friends. But then,
the case must be such, as will bear us out, in being measured
and scrupulous, in regard to the existence, the actual
truth and justice, of what we advance; otherwise our inter-position
will soon be rendered cheap and inefficient; and will
react, in creating want of respect for the writer, instead of
good feeling toward the person recommended. Such, in a
great measure, is the result, in the current value of these
letters, as they are emitted, according to the common forms of
society.</p>

<p>A most affecting proof, that the human heart is not intrinsically
bad, and that the obduracy and cold-blooded selfishness
of the world is adventitious, and the result of our modes and
our training, is, that the sisters of charity, the truly beneficent
everywhere, create a deep sensation of respect in beholders.
Efficient charity is almost the only thing, that no
one feels disposed to question, or slander. A corpse was
borne slowly by me, to the place of its long sleep. An immense
procession followed with sorrow and respect impressed
upon their countenances. I asked, whom they were burying.
‘A single woman without wealth or connexions.&mdash;But
her life has been marked by beneficence.’ If that sex, which
so instinctively desire to appear to advantage, knew, in what
light a lady, distinguished by fortune and cultivation appears
while traversing the dirty and dark lanes of a city, to seek
out, and relieve cases of misery, they would practise charity,
were it from no higher motive, than to create a sensation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and appear lovely. Every one knows the example of the sublime,
quoted by Longinus from Moses. A passage in the
Gospel seems to me still more sublime. <em>He went about
doing good.</em> All other homage, than that which the heart
pays to beneficence, is adventitious. This is real.</p>

<p>Of all the pleasures of our earthly sojourn, after those
of a good conscience, the most varied, and yet equable,
healthful and permanent are those of reading. ‘I have never,’
says a respectable writer, ‘passed a comfortable day without
books since I was capable of reading.’ It is certainly pleasant,
to be able to converse with the wise and instructed of all
countries and all times without formality, without embarrassment,
and just as long as we choose; and then dismiss one of
them without any apology, and sit down with another. We
travel without expense with them. We inhabit the tropics, or
the polar circle, the table summits of mountains, or the wide
plains, at our choice. We journey by land or by sea. We
select congenial minds, and make them converse with us
about our congenial pursuits. We throw away no voice.
We never dialogue in wrath; and intelligence converses with
intelligence, divested of terrene grossness and passion. When
detained on long journeys, in some remote interior tavern, by
a storm, or inability to find a conveyance, how keenly, while
reading almanacks of the past years, and old fragments of
books, found on the dusty shelf of the ordinary, have I felt
the value of books, as a perfect cure for the impatience of
such a position. In this state of privation and intellectual
fasting, we master dull and tiresome books, which, under other
circumstances, we should not have dreamed of reading. Then
the mind is taught to pay the proper homage to these intellectual
resources.</p>

<p>The pleasures of winter reading, in the sacred privacy of
the parlor, are thus finely described by Thomson, the painter
of nature.</p>

<p>Whoever has attempted to concentrate his thoughts in fixed
contemplation upon the origin of the human race, the object
of our present existence, and our prospects beyond it,
upon the character and plan of the divinity, and the
mode of his being, must have felt a painful vagueness, a dizzying
sense of the weakness of our powers, very naturally
preparing us for superstitious and terrific views of
the first cause. But when, in the clear light of reason, I
look upon his creation, on his star-spangled firmament, and
the glory of his works, I should as soon doubt my own existence,
as the perfect wisdom and goodness of the author of
my being. All religion, which does not strengthen our confidence
in this, must be a dreary illusion. Horrible dreams,
dating their origin from the associations of childhood, and the
rant of wild and visionary ministers, may sometimes interpose,
in the uncertain moments between sleeping and waking, as
among the gloomy presentiments and partial delirium of ill
health. But every rational mind must finally settle to repose
in that glorious persuasion, which instantly irradiates the moral
universe with perennial sunshine. ‘The Lord reigneth; let
the earth rejoice.’ In this or any other world, in our present
or any other forms of conscious being, we may advance upon
the unexplored scenes with a full confidence that we can never
travel beyond the beneficence and equity of the infinite
mind.</p>

<p>One of the standing themes of Christian pulpits is the
puerile and absurd views, which the common creed of the
Greeks and Romans presented of the rabble divinities of their
Pantheon; deities, who fought, intrigued, made love, and intoxicated
themselves; deities, who had great power in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
valley, and none on the adjoining hills; deities, who were
conquered, and transferred with their territory, and became in
consequence subservient to their conquerors. I have heard
discussions of this kind in the discourse of the sabbath morning:
and, in that of the evening, views of Christian theology,
scarcely less narrow and unworthy of the Supreme Being. I
am compelled to believe, from reading and observation, that
the mass of the people, in all churches, have had no other
conception of the divinity, than that of a being molded
much like themselves. We cannot avoid discovering, that
their ideas of a God are gross, material, local, partial; that they
behold him, as the God of their place, party and passions.
Converse with the fiercer sects, and you perceive, that their
views immediately become vague, as soon as they contemplate
the Almighty occupied with concerns beyond their sect. It
seems beyond their thoughts, to realize, that their denomination
bears to the species little more than the proportion of a
drop to the ocean: and that the Supreme Being cannot be
rationally supposed more concerned about them, than any other
equal number of his children.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more philosophical, or consoling, than the
Scripture views of what has been called a <em>particular providence</em>.
But, as we hear it generally expounded from the press,
the pulpit, and in common conversation, it offers views of the
divine Being and government, scarcely less weak, monstrous
and unworthy, than those entertained by the ancient pagans.
What a conception, to suppose that a perfect law, as wise and
equitable in its general operation, as infinite wisdom and goodness
could ordain, could be continually infringed, to meet
countless millions of opposing prayers and interests! What
a view of God, to imagine, that earnest and concurrent
prayers can at any time divert him from his purpose, and
change his plans! What palpable misinterpretation of the
Scriptures, to suppose, that they give any countenance to such
debasing conceptions of God! Hear rigid sectarians converse,
and you discover, that they think little of the divine providence,
which has no reference to their individual interests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
concerns. From the tone of their conversations, it is but too
manifest, that they have an interior confidence, that they can
obtain of the divine power, almost what they will.</p>

<p>The testimony of church history and the experience of time
testify, that the million, under all degrees of light, shrink from
the difficult and philosophical idea of the real Jehovah of the
Bible; and form, instead, the easy and natural image of a
limited, partial, changeable God, whom importunity can easily
induce to swerve from his purpose; and who is, in many respects,
such a being as themselves. It is the embodied conception
of their own narrow views, assigned to a local habitation.
To him the countless millions of other lands, and
other forms of worship, are not, like them, as children. Unable
to rise to the Supreme Being, they have brought Him down
to them.</p>

<p>A few minds, from age to age, elevated by endowment and
circumstances far above their cotemporaries, have not only
embraced, in common with others, the easy and simple sentiments
of Him, which the heart entertains, but have raised
their contemplations so high, as to behold Him in the light of
truth&mdash;have seen Him, in some sense, <em>as He is</em>&mdash;have been
filled with awe and confidence, in the view of his immutability,
and with filial and cheerful resignation, in seeing in the
universe, its order, mutations and variety, in the mixed condition
of man, in a word, in every feature of the natural and
moral creation, as in a mirror, a perfect transcript of the
divine perfections&mdash;a pattern of an archetype without a shade
of defect. Instead of bringing the Divine Being down to
them, they have raised themselves up to Him. The veil, that
screens his glory from the feeble vision of the multitude, has
been removed. Being assured, that He has made of one
blood all nations, that dwell on the earth, they have seen it
to be impossible, that He should look upon one portion of his
children with more favor than on another. They have seen,
in the superior light and advantages of one part of the species
over another, not the indication, of what is technically
called <em>special favor</em>, but the natural result of the operation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
his universal laws. They have seen, that if the inhabitants
of one region are enabled to rise higher in the intellectual
scale, and pay him a more spiritual and worthy homage&mdash;the
simple inhabitants of <em>distant, barbarous isles</em> have an organization
admitting them to be as happy as their natures will admit,
and as full of enjoyment as their measure can contain.
If they are unable to offer an intellectual worship, the service
of their minds, their hearts are formed for fervent admiration
and worship of the thunderer&mdash;the being, who raises
fruits and flowers, and hangs out his bow on their clouds.
They see, in all this, <em>that God, also, hath set one thing over
against another</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_47" id="NOTE_47"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_47"><span class="label">Note 47, page 144.</span></a></p>

<p>The wisdom of allowing any place to the imagination,
among the faculties to be nurtured, I have often heard called
in question. The extremes of opinion frequently meet in
the same point. The most earnest declaimers against the indulgence
of the imagination are commonly found among the
class of strict religionists. It is, at the same time, a strong
and prominent trait in the system of Mr Owen ‘the philosopher
of circumstances,’ and his followers, that we ought to
eradicate this faculty, if possible, or at least suppress its exercise;
and reduce all mental operations to the cultivation of
the reasoning powers. For me, I hold, that we are as much
indebted to the author of our being for granting us this faculty,
as any other. I see nothing wrong, or unphilosophical in cultivating
it to the utmost extent; provided our imaginings
would be innocent, if we could render them realities; unless
it can be shown, that the indulgence of this faculty enervates
the mind, and unfits it for encountering the stern duties and
trials of life. So far from believing this to be the natural
tendency of its allowed exercise, my experience has led me
to suppose, that persons, strongly endowed with this faculty,
are most likely to show energy for the discharge of common
duties; and constancy and cheerfulness in encountering trials.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Are the southern people of Europe, for example, less
firm in conflicting with danger and sorrow, or more feeble
and remiss in the discharge of duties, than the northern nations,
admitted to be far less imaginative? Within the range of my
experience, I find those possessed of the most vivid imagination,
the most prompt to duty, and the most cheerful in sorrow.
The moody advocates of pure and exclusive reason lay
feeling, one of the strongest impulses to duty, out of the
question; and would extinguish one of the surest supports in
sorrow, the power of creating a bright internal world for
ourselves, when the external world is involved in unavoidable
gloom.</p>

<p>They who decry the indulgence of the imagination, must,
of course, object to the endowment of poets and painters;
and equally to the pleasure derived from reading poetry, and
contemplating paintings. The whole empire of these kindred
studies is that of the imagination. Let us try the alleged
puerility of indulging this faculty. No one will deny, that
it is the highest wisdom to seek to be as happy, as we innocently
may. When a mental faculty is employed in creating
within us a celestial world, peopled with nobler beings, acting
from higher motives, and showing a happier existence;
and in substituting the beautiful possible for the tame real; if
we find innocent happiness in this celestial castle-building,
are we not employing reason, only in a different direction from
the common? When any one can prove to me, that it is puerile,
to make ourselves happy, and from sources always within our
own control, then I will admit, that ideal pleasures are unworthy
of a reasonable being. Prove only, that the indulgence of
the faculty enervates the mind, and indisposes it for duty and
constancy in suffering, and I will grant at once, that it should
be stifled, or its action restricted or suppressed. So far from
believing this to be the fact, I would counsel him, whom I
most love, to seek in her whom he would select for his wife,
a cheerful and active imagination. It is an egregious mistake,
that mathematicians and practical men have generally been
found destitute of a good development of this faculty. Contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to the vulgar and hackneyed theme of pulpit declamation,
I have found on examination, that some of the most energetically
charitable women, I have ever known, were veteran
novel readers; as have also been some of the most profound
lawyers that have ever adorned the judgment seat in our
country.</p>

<p>It is not exactly true, that this faculty can be subjected to
the complete control of the will. I know of no point in metaphysics,
connected, also, with an important question in rhetoric,
upon which less light has been thrown, than the question,
how far, and in what way the imagination can be cultivated:
and by what methods brought under the control of the will.
A system of useful and practical rules for this result is, as
far as my reading extends, a desideratum. Dr Johnson, it is
well known, believed, that a man’s muse was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sua dextra</i>, his
own will, industry and habits, and that by a vigorous effort
over himself, he could write, for example, at any time. This
may be true in efforts, in which imagination is not required;
but, where the vivid exercise of this faculty is requisite to excellence,
it is not true. Let the most amply endowed poet
suffer under mental depression, dyspepsia, a concurrence of
small misfortunes and petty vexations. Let him write in a
smoky apartment, and look abroad upon a leaden sky, marked
with the dulness of winter, without its storms and congenial
horrors. He may repair to his rules. He may apply the
whip and spur, and invoke the nimble fancies from the
vasty deep, and the muses from their hill, but they will not
answer, nor come at his bidding.</p>

<p>The imagination may be cultivated to a certain extent; and
brought by rules and intense concentration of mind, in a certain
degree, under the control of the will. Those, who would
nurture it, ought intensely to study those rules. But, after all,
to be able to exercise it in high measures of vivacity, is an endowment,
in the bestowment of which nature has been more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
capricious than in almost any other. Even when possessed in
copious measures, its province lies so intermediate between corporeal
and mental influence, between the prevalent temperament
of the period of its action, and the concurrence of external
circumstances beyond our control, that we can easily see,
why the wise ancients, who thought more justly upon these
subjects, and more profoundly than the moderns seem to be willing
to apprehend, attributed the successful efforts of the muses
to a superior and celestial influence. He, who pushes the
theory of our control over this faculty beyond truth, adopts
an error, nearly if not quite as dangerous, as he, who holds,
that we have no control over it at all.</p>

<p>A thousand external circumstances, which it would require
a volume to enumerate, must concur with a certain easy and
strong excitability in the physical and mental frame; and that
excitability called into action by the right sort of stimulants, to
impart happy and vigorous action to the imagination. Milton
affirmed, that his muse was most propitious in the spring. As
far as I can judge, the season of reproduction, and the awakening
of the slumbering powers of nature, in the aroma and
brilliancy of vegetation and flowers, acts too voluptuously on
the senses, to give the highest and best direction to the imagination.
The Indian summer days of autumn, with the associated
repose of nature, the broad and crimson disk of the
sun enthroned in the dome of a misty sky, the clouds sleeping
in the firmament, the gorgeous coloring of the forests, the
flashing fall of the first leaves, and the not unpleasing sadness
of the images, called up by the imperceptible decay of
nature, and the stealthy approach of winter, seem to me most
favorable to heavenly musing. A cloudless morning, a beautiful
sun, the glittering brightness of the dew drops, the renovated
freshness of nature, morning sounds, the mists rolling
away from the path of the sun, a bland southwest breeze,
good health, self-satisfaction, the recent reception of good
news, and the right train of circumstances all concur to put
this faculty into its happiest action.</p>

<p>Every one is acquainted with the unsparing ridicule bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
on Bayes, in Buckingham’s Rehearsal, for announcing,
that he always took physic, before he wrote. Yet the dull
coxcomb had reason and truth on his side. Mental action is
more dependent upon corporeal, and the ethereal powers upon
the right disposition of that organized clod, the body, than
most are willing to acknowledge. Who has not felt, when
first going abroad from severe sickness, the new aspects of nature,
a fullness of heart, and the crowding of innumerable
images upon the thoughts, which have no place in the mind,
after a turtle feast or a full dinner? When the digestive powers
are oppressed with morbid accumulation, the wheels of
mental movement, as every one knows, move heavily. Students,
orators, painters, poets, imaginative men must live as
near famine as may be, and the most useful stimulants are
coffee and tea. Every one has read, that Byron’s inspiration
was gin. It may be, that the detestible combination of terebinthine
and alcoholic excitement may have aroused from the
mouldy and terrene dormitories of his brain the images of Don
Juan, and the obscene, irreligious, anti-social, and fierce
thoughts, that abound in his works. But I would hardly believe,
on his own assertion, that he wrote the Prisoners of Children
under such an influence. The muse of alcohol is accursed;
and her influence is too corroding, dreggy, and adverse
to life, to originate ideas worthy of being handed down in
immortal verse. If these baleful aids were resorted to at all, I
should consider opium a thousand times preferable to alcohol.</p>

<p>I know, from my own experience, that this reality of actual
and present existence may be imparted to the creations of
the imagination, by long habits of subjecting it to the control
of the will. The enjoyment, resulting from reality, may be
more intense, but it is, also, more tumultuous and feverish. I
know of no happiness, more pure, prolonged and tranquil, more
like what we may imagine to be the bliss of higher intelligences,
than to be able to create this sunshine of the soul, this
fair and celestial world within ourselves, and make ourselves
free denizens of the country. From these fairy mansions labor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
care and want are excluded. The obstacles and impediments
of time, distance, and disease, both of body and mind,
are excluded. The inhabitants, walking in the light of truth
and the radiance of immortal beauty, from sin and death forever
free, unite the wisdom of angels to the simplicity and
affectionate confidence of children.</p>

<p>No people, in my estimation, are farther from true wisdom,
than they, who denounce these pleasures of the imagination,
as the puerile follies of weak minds. They who are most
prompt to bring the charge, are generally destitute of the
faculty, and its kindred endowments themselves; and seem
to desire that other minds should be reduced to their own
scale of sterility. Puerile, to avail ourselves of the power of
rendering ourselves innocently happy! To me the puerility
belongs to those who mostly abstain from contemplating the
few gleams of sunshine, that we can behold between the cradle
and the grave. ‘But these joys are unreal!’ What is
there in the <em>vain show</em> of life, that is not so? See the greedy
scramble of ambition, after honor, wealth and distinction, the
painted baubles of insects, who hold all by the frail tenure of
life! Life itself, what is it, but a dream, sometimes illumined
by the rainbows of imagination and hope?</p>

<p>A being endowed with such intense emotions, as man; and
so placed, as to have them so strongly called forth by the relations
he contracts: so much in the dark in regard to his origin,
his end and everything about him, conscious, that he
must shortly leave home, all that he loves, the view of the
earth and the sky, and that body, which long habit has taught
him to consider as himself, to molder back to the soil, should
naturally be expected to have this tendency to melancholy.
Beautifully said the fabulist, ‘that he who formed us, moistened
the clay of our structure not with water but tears.’ The
natural expression of the human countenance in sleep is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
shaded with a slight veil of melancholy. It has been observed,
that the national music of all people, and, more especially, of
the uncivilized tribes, is on a key of melancholy. Most of
the voices of the animal tribes are of this cast. The strain of
the nightingale is the deepest expression of this sentiment.
Religion should be the grand re-agent, in bringing light and
cheerfulness to a universe of sadness and death, by presenting
new views of that universe, its author, his beneficence,
and the ultimate hope of the soul.</p>

<p>With the honorable exception of some towns and districts in
our country, the epitaphs and monumental inscriptions are
utterly beneath criticism. The greater portion are from
Watts, and the other minor poets, too often little more than extravagant,
coarse, miserable conceits. Here and there, a beautiful
quotation from the Bible, such as ‘Blessed are the dead,
who die in the Lord;’ ‘Man cometh forth, like a flower, and
is cut down,’ only serve to render the worthlessness of the
remainder more conspicuous by contrast. What adds to the
unpleasant effect is, that no inconsiderable portion of them
are absolutely misspelt, to say nothing of the punctuation.
Strange, that survivors should incur the expense of a slab, and
permit a stone-cutter to select, spell, and point the inscriptions.
It is to be hoped, that some competent writer will, ere long,
take in hand this matter, so vital to the literary reputation of
our country, and introduce a thorough and general reform, by
wiping away this national stain, and introducing that beautiful
and sublime simplicity, which ought always to characterize
monumental inscriptions.</p>

<p>Akin to the bad taste of this sort, is the slovenly manner
in which our church-yards are kept, in whole sections of the
country. Who has not felt pain, at seeing many and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
most of these places sacred to memory, in the western county
especially, uninclosed, trampled upon by cattle, and the
narrow heap of turf disturbed by swine?</p>

<p>Of writers, whose works have been immortalized by the
muse of melancholy, I am acquainted, in the French language,
with Chateaubriand, who has produced occasional passages
of this class not to be surpassed; and Lamartine, whose poetry
breathes a rich and deep strain of melancholy. Young’s
Night Thoughts, Blair’s Grave, and Porteus ‘on Death,’ are
celebrated English specimens of this class of poetry. In our
country the Thanatopsis of Bryant ranks quite as high as
either of the former writers in this walk. Some of the
lines are of exquisite beauty, as paintings of the trophies of
the tomb. Another age will do justice to many of the
thoughts in the Sorotaphion of a young poet, who has written
on the remote shores of Red River.</p>

<p>The first lines of the inscription on the famous Roman
statue of Sleep are the sublimest concentration of melancholy
thought:</p>

<p>‘It is better to sleep, than wake; and best of all to be in
marble.’</p>

<p>The same may be said of that of the orphan nun, who died
in the prime of youth and beauty: ‘I was alone among the
living. I am alone here.’</p>

<p>But it is in the book of Job, that poetic images, upon which
has been thrown the shade of a sublime melancholy, are set
forth, with a power and pathos that leave little more, to succeeding
writers in that walk, than to study, combine, and reproduce
their features. How perfectly has this author given
utterance to the groans of one in utter despondency and bereavement!
Here the heart speaks its own language, with a
simplicity and truth to make its way to every other heart.
These features fix the date of this poem at a period antecedent
to the settled art of writing, and plagiarizing the shadow of a
shade, more conclusively than volumes of criticism. He copied
not; but drank at the fountain; feeling deeply, and expressing
what he felt.</p>

<p>When in my travels I pass through a town, or village, which
I have not seen, if I have sufficient leisure, the first place
which I visit, is uniformly the church-yard. The feeling
that I am a stranger, that I know not the scenery, and
that it knows not me, naturally induces a sort of pensive meditation,
which disposes me for that sojourn. I form certain estimates
of the taste and moral feeling of the people, from the
forms and devices of the slabs and monuments; and the order
in which the consecrated ground is inclosed, and kept.
The inscriptions are ordinarily, in too bad a taste to claim
much interest, though there are few church-yards, that cannot
show some monuments, which, by their eccentric variation
from the rest, mark character. All this is a matter of trifling
interest, compared with the throng of remembrances and anticipations,
that naturally crowd upon the spirit of a stranger
in such a place. Youth with its rainbows, and its loves; mature
age with its ambitious projects; old age in the midst of
children, death in the natal spot, or the house of the stranger;
eternity with its dim and illimitable mysteriousness; these
shadowy images, with their associated thoughts, pass through
the mind, and return, like the guests at an inn. While I
look up towards the rolling clouds, and the sun walking his
unvarying path along the firmament, how natural the reflection,
that they will present the same aspect, and suggest the same
reflections, that the trees will stand forth in their foliage and
the hills in their verdure, to him who comes after me, when I
shall have taken my place with the unconscious sleepers about
me! I never fail to recollect the charming reflections in a
number of the Spectator, that treats upon a visit to Westminster
Abbey, the most impressive writing of the kind, as it
seems to me, in our language.</p>

<p>Here is the place to reflect upon the folly, if not the guilt,
of human hatred and revenge, ambition and avarice, and the
million puerile projects and cares, that are incessantly over-clouding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the sunshine of existence. What an eloquent lesson
do these voiceless preachers read, upon the wisdom of most of
those thoughts and solicitudes, that disturb our course through
life!</p>

<p>The heart cannot but be made better by occasional communion
with these tenants of the narrow house, where&mdash;</p>

<p>It is questionable, how far they could lay claim to be the
real friends of humanity, who would reason away this last,
best solace of human wretchedness, even were it proved an
illusion. But man is just as certainly and necessarily a religious
being, as he is a being constituted with appetites and
passions. Grant, that there are people, who seem wholly destitute
of the religious sentiment. Such are the real Atheists
from internal conviction; for observe, there are many, who
assume to be such, to pass for free and independent thinkers,
and who are most likely, in their dying moments, to require
absolution and extreme unction. But if there are men thus
monstrously constituted, so are there individuals apparently
as destitute of the common appetites and passions. We take
no account of such exceptions, in indicating a general rule;
and say, that man is constituted a religious being, and possessed
of certain appetites and passions; although there may be
selected a few individuals, who seem entirely without either.</p>

<p>Religion is the key stone of the arch of the moral universe.
It is the fountain of endearing friendship; and on it are founded
those sublime relations, which exist between the visible
and the invisible world; those, who still sojourn here, and
those who have become citizens of the country beyond us. It
is the poesy of existence, the basis of all high thought and
virtuous feeling; of charities and morals; and the very tie
of social existence. Let no person claim to be good, while
laying an unhallowed hand upon this ark of the covenant of
the Eternal with the children of sorrow and death.</p>

<p>Treatises upon the evidences of religion may be useful for
theological students; and I have heard people affirm, that they
have been rescued by such works from the gloom of unbelief.
But, believing, as I do, that we were constituted religious
animals, if such a term may be admitted, and that the
religious sentiment is a part of our organization, I have quite
as much confidence in the arguments of the heart, as of the
head. I undertake not to pronounce, whether M. de Chateaubriand
were a good christian, or not. But I affirm, that I have
nowhere seen my own views of the process, by which the
original endowment of the religious sentiment is called into
action, so eloquently described, as in the following extract
from that writer.</p>

<p>‘My mother, after being thrown, at the age of seventy-two
years, into a dungeon, where she saw a part of her children
perish, expired at last upon a couch of straw, to which her
miseries had consigned her. The remembrance of my errors
infused great bitterness into her last days. In death she
charged one of my sisters to recall me to that religion, in
which I had been reared. My sister transmitted me the last
wish of my mother. When this letter reached me beyond
the seas, my sister herself was no more. She had died from
the consequences of her imprisonment. These two voices,
proceeding from the tomb, this death, which served as the interpreter
of the dead, deeply struck me. I did not yield, I
admit, to great supernatural lights. My conviction proceeded
from the heart. I wept, and I believed.’</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_55" id="NOTE_55"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_55"><span class="label">Note 55, page 157.</span></a></p>

<p>The belief naturally originated by the sentiment of religion,
or what may be called the faith of the heart, is presented
in the last fruitless attempt of the old man, to cheer the despair
of Paul in the exquisite tale of Paul and Virginia. ‘And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
why deplore the fate of Virginia? Virginia still exists. There
is, be assured, a region, in which virtue receives its reward.
Virginia now is happy. Oh! if from the abode of angels, she
could tell you, as she did, when she bade you farewell, “O Paul,
life is but a trial. I was faithful to the laws of nature, love
and virtue. Heaven found I had fulfilled my duties, and
snatched me forever from all the miseries, I might have endured
myself; and all, I might have felt for the miseries of
others. I am placed above the reach of all human evils, and
you pity me! I am become pure and unchangeable, as a particle
of light, and you would recall me to the darkness of human
life. O Paul! O my beloved friend! Recollect those
days of happiness, when in the morning we felt the delightful
sensations excited by the unfolding beauties of nature; when
we gazed upon the sun, gilding the peaks of those rocks;
and then spreading his rays over the bosom of the forests.
How exquisite were our emotions, while we enjoyed the glowing
colors of the opening day, the odors of our shrubs, the
concerts of our birds! Now at the source of beauty, from
which flows all that is delightful on earth, my soul intuitively
sees, tastes, hears, touches, what before she could only be
made sensible of through the medium of our weak organs.
Oh! what language can describe, those shores of eternal
bliss, which I inhabit forever! All, that infinite power and celestial
bounty can confer, that harmony, which results from
friendship with numberless beings, exulting in the same felicity,
we enjoy in unmixed perfection. Support, then, the
trial which is allotted you, that you may heighten the happiness
of your Virginia, by love, which will know no termination,
by hymeneals, which will be immortal. There I will
calm your regrets; I will wipe away your tears. Raise your
thoughts towards infinite duration, and bear the evils of a
moment.”’</p>

<p>Phrenologists affirm, that along the centre of the crown is
situated the organ of veneration, or religious sentiment; that,
where it is large, the subject is strongly endowed with religious
feeling, and the contrary, when it is otherwise; that, with
some few monstrous exceptions, all possess this organ in a
larger or smaller degree; and that, as the sentiment springing
from the action of this organ is directed towards proper
or improper objects, enlightened by reason, rendered gloomy
by fear, or superstitious by credulity, is the religious character
of the person. Neither my subject, nor my inclination
calls upon me to agitate a system, which has generally been
met only with unsparing ridicule, instead of manly argument.
With its doctrines or merits I intermeddle not in this place.
But, as far as the system declares, that those people, whom
we call pious, whose tone of mind seems to dispose them to
strong religious feeling, are so inclined from organization,
rather than volition, or argument, I most confidently believe.
Morals, whatever is taught by the science of ethics, dogmas,
ceremonies, commonly phrased religion, make, in my mind,
no part of it. I consider religion to be simply love, originating
from instinctive impulses of veneration in the mind, for
whatever is powerful, beneficent, and worthy of love. Its
native tendency is to expend its affection, first upon the unknown
and incomprehensible power, from whom we derived
our being, whom the heart, without argument, intuitively perceives
to be good. Its next and associated tendency is philanthropy,
or the love of what bears the impress and image
of God. If we possess not this original organization, no argument
will ever persuade us to be religious. If we have it,
we may be liberal, or bigoted, Christians or Mahometans, earnest
or cold, according to our proportion of endowment, our
training and circumstances. We may even adopt the flippant
arguments of the unbelieving, and enlist ourselves under
their banner. But the original principle is still within us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
uneradicated, and uneradicable; and ready, if circumstances
should favor the change, to present us in the form of devotees,
or, as the phrase is, <em>converted</em>. The whole wisdom and
excellence of religious training consist in enlightening this
noble sentiment, and giving it a right direction. I am the
rather confirmed in these views, by having remarked, that the
chief, palpable and tangible influences of religion, which I have
witnessed in all the sects, that I have had occasion to observe,
have seemed to me to result from the affectionate spirit
of their worship, creating in them strong dispositions to love
one another.</p>

<p>Open the gospels and the epistles, and what is the first impression
from perusing these unique and original writings,
so wholly unlike any other recorded compositions, and bearing
upon a theme of such astonishing import? The simplicity
and fervor, with which the spirit of love is impressed upon
the pages. The strong and before unwitnessed manifestation
of this spirit was the striking aspect, which the first Christians
presented to pagan beholders. ‘See!’ said they, ‘how
these Christians love one another.’ Every time, I peruse the
writings of the New Testament, this peculiar badge of discipleship
seems more visibly impressed upon them. In
what other institution, but that of Christianity, was it ever
practicable to possess all things in common? Where has been
the community, in which no one felt want, when a disciple
had wherewith to satisfy it? In what other chronicles do we
meet with such affecting and sublime examples of devotion
to each other, and a constancy of affection, which showed itself
proof against all other human passions, selfishness, hope,
fear, earthly love, and the terror of death? What tenderness
and singleness of heart in their affection for each other!
How beautifully they demonstrate, that the sentiment, which
actuated them, had gained a complete triumph over all considerations,
arising from objects below the sun? He on whose
bosom the loved disciple leaned must certainly be admitted
to know the peculiar and distinguishing feature of his religion.
This feature stands forth embodied in all his teachings. Philanthropy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
is the predominant trait in the life of him, <em>who went
about doing good</em>. Consider the basis of religion to be a sentiment
implanted in our constitution, and this result would
naturally be expected to flow from its development.</p>

<p>True religion, consisting in an enlightened and affectionate
direction of the heart towards the divinity, and manifesting
itself in love to the human family, and in consequent obedience
to the universal and unchangeable laws of the Creator,
can only be expected to result from the highest discipline
of the mind, and the ultimate exercise of the purest reason.
But the sentiment, from which this religion springs, in some
form or other, as naturally impels the heart towards God, and
its faith and aspirations towards immortality, as fishes desire
to find their home in the water, or birds in the air; and as everything,
that has life, obeys the peculiar instincts and impulses
impressed by the divine hand. Why else, should every
people under heaven, in all time, have been found with a religion
in some form, and hopes and fears beyond the grave?
Consider religion in this light, and its hopes are as sure, as
those objects, towards which the instincts of all other animals
prompt them.</p>

<p>Do I undervalue morals, since I do not deem them a part,
of what should be properly called religion? I trust, I cannot
be so mistaken. Ethics may be taught, as a science, and, however
important, seems to me no more a part of religion, than
mathematics or natural philosophy. Love will create morals;
and its perfection the perfection of morals, that we ascribe to
angels. All that has been urged from the pulpit, in regard
to faith and works, as cause and effect, may, with still
more justice, be applied to love and duty. Love is the faith
of the heart, and its original impress, when rightly trained in
the science of ethics, and enlightened by pure and simple reason,
produces its results in the best exemplification of the
christian character.</p>

<p>That person has no right to complain of the shortness of
life, who lies in bed, either sleeping, or dozing, until nine;
and thus voluntarily consigns to unconsciousness a twelfth
part of his existence. As little reason has he for indulging a
querulous spirit on this score, if he spends without object a
considerable portion of his time with people, about whom he
knows nothing, except that they are incapable of furnishing
a moment’s pleasure, or instruction to any one. If each one
noted down at night the incidents of the day, that had occupied
his time, and how much of it he had appropriated to each,
I fear all that portion, that we call people of leisure would
be able to show but a lean schedule either of utility or enjoyment,
as the result.</p>

<p>Complaints of the brevity of life are equally interdicted to
all those, who do not wisely improve every hour of the brief
and uncertain present. He, who regretted his stinted fortune,
would find, and deserve little sympathy, if, in the very moments
of complaining, he was seen inconsiderately squandering
from that limited fund. To form a resolution to mark
every moment of life, that we might, with a succession of
pleasant ideas, would probably triple the duration of most human
lives. To sleep no more than nature requires, to rise
early, to discipline ourselves to preserve an elastic and active
spirit and a vigorous will, are parts of this resolution. It is
a much greater part, than is commonly apprehended, to waste
as little time as possible on those, who are incapable of understanding
us, and whom we are as little capable of understanding.
Reciprocal good feeling is much more likely to be
created, and sustained by those who are determined to avoid
this course, than those who, from mere unmeaning civility and
common etiquette, bring their incompatibilities together, to
make common stock of a mutual weariness with each other,
which soon ripens into concealed, if not expressed ill feeling.</p>

<p>They, who are accustomed to think in this direction, will
easily fill out the fine outline of the author’s views touching the
right mode to arrest the flight of time. To add to this sketch
would require an extent of detail, for which I have here no
place. The general principle of this process seems to consist
in meeting pain and adversity with a spirit so philosophic
and firm that they will recoil from it; and to dwell upon every
innocent enjoyment, as though it were our first, and would be
our last; to prolong it by investing it with all possible moral
relations; and to discipline the mind never to become hackneyed,
sated, wearied, and callous to the sense of objects in
which man is bound to feel an interest, alike by his duty and
his nature.</p>

<p>Never was a more stupid maxim, than that common one,
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nil admirari</i> is the proper motto of a philosopher. To
preserve a freshness, a juvenile sensibility of the heart for
the admiration of whatever is new, beautiful and striking, for
all the pleasures of taste and the understanding, seems
to me the true secret of the highest wisdom. Who can
fail to be inspired with disgust at witnessing the common spectacle
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</i>, men of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virtu</i>, travelled fools, who have
been everywhere, and seen everything; and by the contemptuous
sneer, with which they effect to see, hear, feel and speak
of all, that passes under their present observation, instruct
you, that they are too wise, and of a taste too refined, to be
pleased with what satisfies untravelled people. For my part,
when I hear them boast of the music, paintings and architecture
of continental Europe, and England, as though all the sources
of beauty were there, I can only say, that nature is always
at hand, to mock at all the puny efforts of art; that she delights
to mould living faces and forms in remote country cottages,
that no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</i> can reach; that the songs of the birds,
that return from other climes to their forsaken groves with
the first sunny days of spring constitute a music richer to the
heart, than the most fashionable opera; and that a pure spring
landscape is a pictured thousand times more splendid, than any
that ever adorned the walls of the Louvre. He, who preserves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to his utmost age, his youthful sensibility of heart, and
who is willing to be pleased with whatever will impart innocent
pleasure, will find innumerable and never failing occasions
to give his heart up to the full impulses of joy.</p>

<p>‘I pity,’ says Sterne, ‘the man, who can travel from Dan to
Beersheba, and cry ’tis all barren; and yet so it is; and so
is all the world, to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers.
I declare said I, clapping my hands cheerly together, that
were I in a desert, I would find in it the wherewith to call
forth my affections. If I could not do better, I would fasten
them on some sweet myrtle, or seek some melancholy cypress,
to connect myself to. I would court its shade, and greet
it kindly for its protection; I would cut my name upon
it, and swear, it was the loveliest tree in the desert. If
its leaves withered, I would teach myself to mourn; and
when they rejoiced, I would rejoice with them.’</p>

<p>I consider it no unimportant part of the process of prolonging
our earthly sojourn, to lay in, if I may so speak, as great a
stock as possible, of pleasant remembrances. I appeal to
the experience of every one, if the sudden recollection of a
foolish thing that we have said, or done, returning upon us after
a lapse of years, has not brought back with the convulsive
shudder of shame, a long train of associated remembrances,
which have carried us back whole days upon the scene? How
long seem the periods, in which these incidents occurred!
Pleasant recollections are no less efficient, in prolonging the
periods, in which they occurred, adding their duration to the
sum of the fugitive existence that is stealing from us.</p>

<p>For myself I can confidently affirm, that I have long since
learned to find my purest and most abiding satisfactions in
the memory of the past. I repeat all its happier passages and
incidents. I recall the bright days, verdant landscapes, loved
persons, and joyous sensations from their shadowy mansions.
I renew my youthful sports; and watch for the trout along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
flush spring brooks. I seat myself again on the sunny banks
of the pleasant spots of my career. I would be glad to convey
some idea of the vivid pleasure, I experience after a lapse
of forty winters, from the deeply impressed remembrance of
one beautiful spring morning, after a long and severe winter,
when I was still a school-boy. The vast masses of snow
were beginning to melt. The birds of prey, shut up in their
retreats during the bitter winter, sailed forth in the mild clear
blue. The blue bird whistled; and my heart expanded with
joy and delight unknown, in the same degree, before or since.
The place where these thoughts, comprising my youthful anticipations,
hopes and visions occurred, will never be obliterated
from my mind, while memory holds her seat. I have a
thousand such treasured recollections, with which I can at any
time, and to a certain extent, cheer pain, sorrow and decay.
These are enjoyments stored beyond the reach of fortune,
which we can prolong, and renew at pleasure.</p>

<p>Is there not practical wisdom, in commencing every day
with the steady effort, to make as much of it, as if it were to
be our whole existence. If we have duties to perform, in
themselves severe and laborious, we may inquire, if there be
not some way, by which to invest them with pleasant associations?
A man may find amusement in his free thoughts, while
following his plough upon the hill side; in digging up the words
for a dictionary, or in copying out a brief. He may train himself,
by an inefficient and shrinking spirit, to recoil from these
tasks, as insupportable burdens. How many men find their
pleasure, in what would be the positive horror and torment of
the indolent! How weak the spirit, and how silly the vanity
which we display, in ever renewing narrations of our little personal
troubles, pains and misfortunes! If we would have the
discretion to measure the sympathy, which we may expect
from others, in such discourses, by that, which we are conscious
of feeling for theirs of the same character, it would go
far to teach us the folly of that querulous spirit, which doles
forth the story of sufferings and sorrows, as though the narrator
were the only sufferer, and were entitled to a monopoly
of all the passing pity.</p>

<p>This compendium of the moral acquirements, entering into
the character of an accomplished philosopher, I consider one
of the happiest, which any book of morals can show. Here
is an ample volume of ethics, on a page. How differently would
a modern auto-biographer have announced the same facts! In
what rounded periods and circuitous expressions would he
have striven to convey the same ideas, to impress the reader,
that his modesty forbade the frank personality of the Roman
philosopher. The whole spirit of this admirable summary
would have evaporated in barren generalities. What we admire
in the ancients is their noble simplicity and directness,
which disdains the vanity of circumlocution, that wishes to
hide itself under the semblance of modesty.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that it would not be amiss for the clergy of
the day to seek the models of their homilies and sermons in
such a manner of declaring moral truth. Abstract ethical declamation,
and all the scholastic acquirements and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">limæ
labor</i> are but poor substitutes for that searching directness,
which, avoiding abstractions and generalities, appeals at once
to the personal consciousness. I allow, that I should love to
hear such sermons, as that of Dr Primrose to his fellow prisoners,
in the Vicar of Wakefield. There is no eloquence,
there can be none, except in simple and direct appeals to
thought and conscience.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_60" id="NOTE_60"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_60"><span class="label">Note 60, page 171.</span></a></p>

<p>Various writers of splendid genius have tasked their
imagination, to present us with the results of endowing a person
with immortality on earth. Such a character has been
delineated with great power by Godwin, in his St Leon; and
by Croly in the story of <cite>Salathiel, or the Wandering Jew</cite>. It
is an instructive labor, to record the wanderings, changes,
weariness, abandonment, and final despair of a wretch cursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
with immortality; and by the circumstance rendered a monster,
out of relation with human beings; and cut off from all
real sympathy with his mortal kind. It is questionable,
whether these writers, or any others who have drawn similar
pictures, have formed adequate conceptions, of what would be
the actual result of an earthly immortality. The view of the
author before me seems just. I can easily imagine the immortal
delivered from earthly sorrows. But, when I contemplate
him divested of the hopes, fears, affections and sympathies,
which trace their origin to our common mortal nature,
I cannot imagine the affections, that are to replace these.</p>

<p>I can conceive none other, than a being, who would become
drowsy at sixty, and sleepy at a hundred. All beyond
presents to me a lethargy of almost unconscious existence,
from which my fancy can devise no effort of sufficient energy
to arouse him. In fact, it is sufficient, that nature has awarded,
in her universal decree, that man should not be out of
analogy and relation with the rest of nature; to convince us,
that the decision involves our best interest. The more our
views of nature enlarge, the more we become conscious, that
she has arranged all her laws with such perfect wisdom, that
if we could reverse any of them, we should do it at the expense
of our own happiness.</p>

<p>Of all pictures of men, rendered immortal upon earth, the
most forcible, brief and revolting, is that of Swift. ‘After this
preface, he gave me a particular account of the Struldbrugs
among them. He said, they commonly acted like mortals,
till about thirty years old; after which they grew melancholy
and dejected, increasing in both till they came to fourscore.
This he learned from their own confession; for otherwise,
there not being more than two or three of that species born
in an age, they were too few to form a general observation
by. When they come to fourscore years, which is reckoned
the extremity of living in this country, they had not only all
the follies and infirmities of other men, but many more, which
arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying. They were
not only opinionative, covetous, peevish, morose, vain, talkative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
but incapable of friendship, and dead to all natural
affection, which never descended below their grandchildren.
Envy and their impotent desires are their prevailing passions.
But those objects, against which their envy seems particularly
directed, are the vices of the younger sort, and the death of
the old. By reflecting on the former, they find themselves
cut off from all possibility of pleasure; and whenever they
see a funeral, they lament, and repine, that others have gone
to a harbor of rest, at which they can never hope to arrive.
They have no remembrance of anything, but what they learned,
and observed in their youth and middle age, and even
that is very imperfect; and for the truth or particulars of
any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than their
best recollection. The least miserable among them, are
those, who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories.
These meet with more pity and assistance, because they want
many bad qualities, which abound in others.</p>

<p>‘If a Struldbrug happen to marry one of his kind, the marriage
is dissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom,
as soon as the younger of the two comes to be fourscore; for
the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence, that those, who are
condemned, without any fault of their own, to a perpetual
continuance in the world, should not have their misery doubled
by the load of a wife. As soon as they have completed the
term of eighty years, they are considered dead in law. At
ninety they lose their teeth and hair, and have no distinction
of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without
relish or appetite. The diseases they were subject to, still
continue without increasing, or diminishing. In talking, they
forget the common appellations of things, and the names of
persons, even of those, who are their nearest friends and relations.
For the same reason, they can never amuse themselves
with reading, because their memory will not serve to
carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and
by this defect they are deprived of the only entertainment
whereof they might be capable.</p>

<p>‘They were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the women more horrible than the men. Besides the usual
deformities in extreme old age, they acquired an additional
ghastliness, in proportion to their number of years, which is
not to be described; and among half a dozen, I soon distinguished
who was the oldest, although there was not above a
century or two between them.</p>

<p>‘The reader will easily believe, from what I have heard
and seen, that my keen appetite for perpetuity and life was
much abated. I grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions
I had formed, and thought no tyrant could invent a death into
which I would not run with pleasure, from such a life. The
king heard all that had passed between me and my friends
upon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly, wishing I
could send a couple of Struldbrugs to my own country, to
arm our people against the fear of death.’</p>


<p class="center"><a name="NOTE_61" id="NOTE_61"></a><a href="#NOTEanchor_61"><span class="label">Note 61, page 171.</span></a></p>

<p>Fear, absolutely useless, gratuitous fear, probably constitutes
much the largest proportion of the whole mass of human
misery; and of this proportion the fear of death is the
principal part. There are but very few people who, in examining
the feeling of revulsion and horror, most constantly
present to their minds, will not find it to be the dread of
death. The whole observation, which I have made upon
human nature, has only enlightened me the more as to the
universality and extent of the influence of this evil. I see it
infusing bitterness into the bosoms of the young, before they
are as yet capable of reflection; and ceasing not to inspire
its terrors into the heart, which has experienced the sorrows
of fourscore winters. I see little difference in the alarm
with which it darkens the mind of the heir, elate with youthful
hope, and the galley slave&mdash;those apparently the most happy,
and the tenants of penitentiaries and lazar-houses. All
cling alike convulsively to life, and shudder at the thought of
death.</p>

<p>Part, and perhaps the greater part, of this fear is a sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
heritage, which has been transmitted down to us, an accumulating
fund of sorrow, for a hundred generations. I have
stated my conviction in another place, that our education, religious
ceremonies, domestic manners, in short, all the influences
of the present institutions of society tend to increase
this evil. I am well aware, at the same time, that the number
of those, who will admit it to be an evil, is but small.
Most view it as it has been considered in all Christian countries,
from time immemorial, as an instrument in the hand of
God and his servants, to awe, and restrain the mind, recall
it from illusions and vanities, and reduce it to the seriousness
and obedience of religion. The broad declamation of the
pulpit for effect, revolting representations of hell-torment
and the vindictive justice of God, have passed with a readier
tolerance, under a kind of tacit allowance, that if the means
were unworthy, the proposed end was such as would sanctify
them. It is almost unnecessary to remark, that all my
hope of producing any useful impression is with the small,
but growing number, (in the next age, I trust, it will be a
majority) who hold this whole doctrine in utter unbelief;
who have no faith in amendment and conversion, that
grows out of the base and servile principle of fear; and least
of all the fear of death; who believe that a great reform, a
thorough amelioration of our species, will never be effected,
until it is made a radical principle of our whole discipline,
and all our social institutions, to bring this servile passion
completely under the control of our reason. With these, it is
a deep and fixed conviction, that every thing base, degrading
and destructive of intellect and improvement, readily associates
with fear; and that the basis of true religion, generous
conception, high thoughts and really noble character, is firmly
laid in a young mind, when trained to become as destitute
of fear, as if it were conscious of being a sinless angel,
above the reach of pain or death.</p>

<p>It would be to no purpose for me to pause in this place, to
obviate the strictures of those who will denounce this doctrine,
by quoting from the scriptures the frequent inculcations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of the <em>fear of the Lord</em>, and the Apostle’s declaration, that
by the <em>terrors of the Lord we persuade men</em>. The true and
religious fear, inculcated in the scriptures, not only has no
relation to the passion I am discussing, but cannot exist, any
more than the other requisite traits of religious character, in
a bosom swayed by the grovelling and selfish passion of servile
fear.</p>

<p>That nature has implanted in our bosoms an instinctive
dread of death, I readily admit. But fear, as a factitious and
unnatural addition to the true instincts of human nature, has
been so accumulated by rolling down through a hundred
generations, that we are in no condition to know the degree,
in which nature intended we should possess it. We
have innumerable base propensities, which we charge upon
nature, that are, in fact, no more, than the guilty heritage,
bequeathed us by our ancestors. Nature could have implanted
no higher degree of instinctive dread of death, than just
what was requisite, to preserve the race from prodigal waste,
or rash exposure of a gift, which, once lost, is irretrievable.
If nature has inwrought in any constitution one particle of
fear, beyond what was required for this result, she has, as in
all other excessive endowments, granted reason and judgment,
to regulate, and reduce it to its due subordination.</p>

<p>Will not religion achieve the great triumph of casting out
the base principle of fear? I would be the last to deny, or
undervalue the trophies of true religion. I have no doubt
that religion has, in innumerable instances, extracted the pain
and poison from the sting of death. More than this, it would
unquestionably produce this triumph in every case, if every
individual were completely under the influence of the true
principle. It would attain this end by processes and discipline
exactly concurrent, if not similar, with those I am about
to propose. But it is a lamentable fact, that very few are
under the influence of true religion. Of those, whom charity
deems most sincerely pious, under all professions and
forms, the far greater number exhibit, on the bed of dangerous
sickness, the same fear of death with the rest. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
consider this a generally conceded fact; for, among all but
the most extravagant sects, death-bed terror, or triumph has
ceased to be considered a test of the personal religion of the
deceased. Even in the cases of enthusiastic triumph in the
last moments, which we have all witnessed, and which are
justly so soothing to the survivors, it would often be difficult
to determine the respective influence of laudanum, and partial
insanity doing its last work upon the nervous system.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the triumph over the fear of death, which
I would inculcate, should not be tested by the equivocal deportment
of the patient, in the near view of death; but by
his own joyous consciousness of deliverance from this tormenting
thraldom and bondage, during his whole life. Let
fear and horror crowd what bitterness they may into the last
few hours, it can bear but little proportion to the long agony
of a whole life, passed in <em>bondage through fear of death</em>. To
produce the desired triumph, the highest training of philosophy
should concur with the paternal spirit and the immortal
hopes of the gospel; and a calm, reasoning, unboasting fearlessness
of death should enable us to taste all the little of
pure and innocent joy, that may be found between the cradle
and the grave&mdash;as unmolested, as unsprinkled with this fear,
as if the destroyer were not among the works of God.</p>

<p>How may this result be obtained? How may a generation
be so trained as to lose not a particle of enjoyment, nor
be influenced to one unworthy act, by the fear of death?
To answer these questions, in the requisite detail of illustration,
would require volumes. It might, perhaps, best be
done by selecting a single child as an example; and by developing,
at every advancing step, the process of his training;
pointing out every instance, in which it would be necessary
to withdraw him from the influence of the present systems
of discipline; in which, in a word, his whole education should
be conducted with a preponderant purpose, among other
desirable results, to render him perfectly fearless of death.
It is hoped that some one of those, who believe this a chief
desideratum in the reformation and improvement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
present system of education, will take this great point in
hand; and in this way indicate to the age the modes of discipline,
through which this result may be expected. It is
obvious, that a much severer discipline would be required for
the first generation so trained, than for the second; who, with
less transmitted cowardice than their parents, would perpetuate
a constantly improving moral constitution to the generations
to come. My present plan admits only a brief summary
of motives and arguments, commonly adduced, as calculated
to diminish, regulate, and subdue the fear of death.
It is evident, that these motives and arguments are predicated
upon present opinions, and such as may be supposed capable
of acting upon the existing generation, enduring the hereditary
and inculcated bondage of this passion.</p>

<p>1. The terrific and undefinable images of horror, that imagination
affixes to the term <em>death</em>, are founded in an entire misconception.
The word is the sign of no positive idea whatever.
It conjures up a shadowy horror to the mind, finely
delineated, as a poetic personage, by Milton; and implies
some agony that is supposed to lie between the limits of existence
and non-existence, or existence in another form.
This is simple illusion. So long as we feel, death is not&mdash;and
when we cease to feel, or commence feeling in a changed
form, death has been:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuit mors</i>. So that the term imports a
mere phantom of the imagination. In the words of Droz, ‘it
is not yet; or it is past.’ If one can arrest the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">punctum stans</i>,
and the actual sensation, where waking consciousness terminates,
and sleep commences, he can tell us, what death is.
Every one is conscious of having passed through this change;
but no one can give any account, what were his sensations in
the dividing moment of interval between wakefulness and
sleep.</p>

<p>2. Imagination is allowed to settle all the circumstances, and
form all the associations belonging to the supposed agony of
this event. It is one of the few important incidents in life,
upon which reason is never allowed to fix a calm and severe
scrutiny. It has been seen in a light, too sacred and terrible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to permit such a lustration. ‘It is dreadful,’ says common
apprehension, ‘for it is the breaking up the long and
tender partnership, and producing a separation between the
body and the soul&mdash;dreadful, because it is the wages of sin, and
is appointed to be a perpetual memorial of the righteous displeasure
of God in view of sin;’ ‘dreadful,’ say others, who
most unphilosophically believe that man was not originally
intended to be mortal, ‘because a violence upon nature;
dreadful, because a departure of the spirit from the regions
of the living, and the light of the sun, into an unknown and
eternal condition. Suns will revolve, moons wax and wane,
years, revolutions, ages, counted by all the particles of mist
in the sea, will elapse, but the place, whence the spirit is gone,
will never know it more.’ ‘It is terrible,’ says common apprehension,
‘for it is often preceded and accompanied by
spasm, and convulsive struggle.’ The psalmody, which we
sing in church, speaks of the <em>ghastly paleness</em>, the <em>chill sweat</em>,
and the <em>mortal coldness</em>, circumstances all, which, seen in other
associations, would assume no aspect of peculiar terror.</p>

<p>Then, too, the attendants in the sick room with a look of
horror inspect the extremities of the patient, and petrify
bystanders with the terrible words, ‘he is struck with death,’
as though the grisly phantom king of the poet’s song had invisibly
glided in, and, with his icy sceptre, given his victim
the blow of mortal destiny. Who knows not that, though
there are usually mortal symptoms, which enable an experienced
eye to foresee approaching dissolution, the term
<em>death-struck</em> imports nothing but the weakest vulgar prejudice,
a prejudice under the influence of which millions have
been suffered to expire, that might have been roused! Innumerable
persons, pronounced to be in that situation, have actually
recovered; and no moment, in the ordinary forms of
disease, can with any certainty be pronounced beyond hope
and the chances of aid, but that which succeeds the last sigh.
Thus every thought of the living, and every aspect of the dying,
by a wayward ingenuity, heightens the imagined horror
of the event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there are conversations and hymns and funeral odes
and Night Thoughts, which speak of the coldness, silence
and eternal desolation of the grave; as though the unconscious
sleeper felt the chill of the superincumbent clay, the
darkness of his narrow house or this terrible isolation from the
living. The pale and peaceful corpse is contemplated with a
look of horror. Two, of stout heart and tried friendship, abide
near the kneaded clod, until the living are relieved from their
ghostly terrors, by its deposition out of their sight in the narrow
house. The family, the children, the friends alike showing
the creeping horror, glide quick and silently on tiptoe
through the apartment, where the sleeper lies. The first
nightfall after the disease is one of peculiar and unmitigated
horror. The family, however disinclined to union before, this
evening unite, with that impress on their countenances, which
words reach not. Now return to their thoughts the nursery
tales, the thrilling narratives of haunted houses and wandering
ghosts; and if the minister comes among them, it is probably
to evoke before their imaginations condemned spirits
doomed to eternal sufferings, quenchless flames, groans without
respite, and all the ineffable and eternal torments, that
the clerical vocabulary of centuries has accumulated.</p>

<p>Need we wonder, that in a christian country, and among
families of the best training, such impressions have become so
universal, that they, who would be reputed brave, blazon their
courage, by affirming their readiness to sleep in a cemetery,
or the funeral vault of a church! It requires no extraordinary
effort, and nothing more than the simple triumph of reason
among the faculties, to enable any man, to sleep alone in a
charnel house with as little dread, as in the apartment of an
inn, so that the places were alike in comfort and salubrity.
It does not require us to be wise, or courageous; but simply
not cowards and fools, to feel as little horror in the view of
corpses, as statues of plaster or marble. One of the most terrible
ideas of death, after all, is, that we shall thus, immediately
upon our decease, inflict this shrinking revulsion of terror
upon all, who look at our remains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>The view, which reason takes of the sick and dying bed is,
that, in the far greater number of mortal cases, the transition
from life to death is as imperceptible, as the progress of the
sun and the seasons. One faculty dies after another. The
victim has received the three warnings unconsciously. Ordinarily,
a person may be said to have paid a third part of his
tribute of mortality at forty-five; half at fifty-five; and the
whole at three score and ten.</p>

<p>When acute and severe sickness assails the patient, he has
passed through what may be called the agony of death at
a very early period of his disease. His chief suffering is
past, as soon the irritability and the vigorous powers of life
have been broken down. When the disorder assumes the
typhoid and insensible form, the dull sleep, that precedes the
final rest of the tomb, is already creeping upon him; and severe
suffering is precluded. If there are convulsions after
this, as often happens, they are seldom more than spasmodic
movements, impressed by the nervous action upon the tendons,
more terrible to the beholder, than the sufferer; differing
little from those starts and struggles, with which many
persons in high health commence sleeping and waking. He
who has experienced the sensation of fainting, and, still more,
of an epileptic fit, has suffered, I am ready to believe, all that
there is in dying.</p>

<p>3. Reason, calmly surveying the case of the dying person
himself, sees many alleviations, of which imagination, sketching
under the influence of the dread of death, takes no account.
He finds himself, in this new predicament, the absorbing object
of all interests and all solicitude and affection. It is not in
human nature, that this should not call up complacent emotions
and slumbering affections from their secret cells. The subsequent
progress towards the last moment brings an imperceptibly
increasing insensibility, manifested by drowsiness and
sleep. Of those, who preserve the exercise of their faculties
entire to the last, many instances are recorded of persons,
who had shown the most unmanly dread of death in their
health, that have met dissolution with the calmness of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
self-possession. Of the rest, the greater number die with
little more apparent pain and struggle, than accompany the
act of sleeping. The greater freshness, vigor and nervous
irritability of young people and children cause that most of
the exceptions are of this description. In a great number of
cases, which I have witnessed, I have paused in doubt, whether
the person had yielded his last sigh, or not, after he had actually
deceased. To soften the last infliction, nature almost
invariably veils it under a low delirium, or absolute unconsciousness.</p>

<p>4. It is impossible to imagine a more obvious and unquestionable
principle of philosophy, than that every reasoning faculty
of our nature must declare to us, loudly and unequivocally,
and with an influence as strong as reason can command, that
it is wisdom, nay, the dictate of the least portion of common
sense, to dread, to resist, to repine, to groan, as little as possible,
in view of an endurance absolutely inevitable. If it be
hard to sustain when met with a fearless, resigned and unmurmuring
spirit, it must certainly be still harder, when we
are obliged to bend our necks to it with the excruciating addition
of shrinking fear, dreadful anticipation and ineffectual
struggles to evade it, and with murmurs and groans, at finding
the inutility of these efforts. Innumerable examples prove to
us, that nature has kindly endowed us with reason and mental
vigor to such an extent, that, under the influence of right
motive and training, no possible form of suffering can be
presented, over which this power may not manifest, and has
not manifested a complete triumph.</p>

<p>Of these innumerable examples, it is only necessary to
cite those of the martyrs, of all forms of religion. These
prove farther, that this undaunted self-possession, in every
conceivable shape and degree of agony, was not the result of
a rare and peculiar temperament, a want of sensibility, or the
possession of uncommon physical courage; that it was not because
there was no perception of danger, or susceptibility of
pain; this magnanimity, this impassibility to fear and pain
and death has been exhibited in nearly equal degrees by people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of every age, each sex and all conditions. Let the proper
motive be supplied, let the martyr have had the common
influence of the training of his faith, and the consequence
failed not. All the shades and varieties of natural and mental
difference of character were noted in the deportment of the
sufferers. But they were alike in the stern proof of a courage,
which defied death. The fact is proved by them, as strongly
as moral fact can be proved, that the mind of every individual
might find in itself native self-possession and vigor, to enable
it to display an entire ascendency over fear, pain and death.</p>

<p>Nor does this fact rest solely for support on the history of
martyrs, or sufferers at an <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Auto da fé</i>, or by torture in any of
its forms. We could find examples of it in every department
of history, and every view of human character. The red men
of our wilderness, as we have elsewhere seen, are still more
astonishing illustrations of this fact&mdash;I say astonishing,
because the timid and effeminate white man shivers, and
scarcely credits his senses, as he sees the young Indian
warrior smoking his pipe, singing his songs, boasting of his
victories and uttering his menaces, when enveloped in a slow
fire, apparently as unmoved, as reckless and unconscious of
pain, as if sitting at his ease in his own cabin. All, that has
been found necessary, by this strange people, to procure this
heroism, is, that the children, from boyhood, should be constantly
under a discipline, every part and every step of which
tends directly to shame and contempt at the least manifestation
of cowardice, in view of any danger, or of a shrinking consciousness
of pain in the endurance of any suffering. The
males, so trained, never fail to evidence the fruit of their discipline.
Sentenced to death, they almost invariably scorn to
fly from their sentence, when escape is in their power. If in
debt, they desire a reprieve, that they may hunt, until their
debts are paid. They then voluntarily return, and surrender
themselves to the executioner. Nothing is more common
than for a friend to propose to suffer for his friend, a parent
for a child, or a child for a parent. When the sufferer receives
the blow, there is an unblenching look, which manifests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the presence of the same spirit, that smokes with apparent
unconcern amidst the crackling flames.</p>

<p>A proof, that this is the fruit of training, and not of native
insensibility, as others have thought, and as I formerly thought
myself, is that this contempt of pain and death is considered
a desirable trait only in the males. To fly, like a woman, like
her to laugh, and weep, and groan, are expressions of contempt,
which they apply to their enemies with ineffable scorn. The
females, almost excluded from witnessing the process of Spartan
discipline, by which the males acquire their mental hardihood,
partake not of the fruits of it, and with some few exceptions,
are shrinking and timid, like the children of civilization.</p>

<p>I know, that there will not be wanting those, who will condemn
alike the training and the heroism, as harsh, savage, unfeeling,
stoical and unworthy to be admitted, as an adjunct to
civilization. But no one will offer to deny, that the primitive
Christian, put in conflict with a hungry lion, that Rogers at
the Smithfield stake, that the young captive warrior, exulting,
and chanting his songs while enduring the bitterest agonies
that man can inflict, in the serene and sublime triumph of
mind over matter, and spirit over the body, is the most imposing
spectacle we can witness, the clearest proof we
can contemplate, that we have that within us which is not
all of clay, nor all mortal; or doubt, that these persons endure
infinitely less physical pain, in consequence of their
heroic self-possession, than they would have suffered, had they
met their torture in paroxysms of terror, shrinking and self-abandonment.</p>

<p>However we may reason, however we may decry these
views, as savage, impracticable, unnatural and undesirable,
the fact is, that we all feel alike upon this subject. The
thousands in a Roman amphitheatre only evinced a trait,
that belongs to our common nature, when they instantly,
and without consulting each other, gave the signal to save
that gladiator, who most clearly manifested cool self-possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and contempt of death. After witnessing the execution of a
criminal, who shows courage, the spectators go away describing,
with animated gesture, and in terms of admiration, the
fearlessness of the fellow the moment before his death. We
all speak with unmingled satisfaction of the circumstance,
in the death of our friends, that they departed in the conscious
dignity of self-possession and hope. All readers are
moved with one sensation, as they read the record of the noble
trait in the character of Cæsar, gracefully folding himself
in his mantle, after he had received so many mortal thrusts.
Few of us hear unmoved of the old English patriot, who requested
the executioner to support him up the steps to the
scaffold, adding that he would shift for himself to get down; or
of the other, who cried, as he stooped his head to the block,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</i>! If I recollect, it is Silliman,
who gives the affecting notice of the last hours of the
duke of Richmond, the late governor general of Canada. Invested
with all conceivable circumstances to render life desirable,
he was bitten by a favorite dog in a rabid state; and
died, in the most excruciating tortures, of the terrible hydrophobia.
When the horrible paroxysm was felt by him to be
approaching, he was accustomed to nerve his sinking courage
by these words; ‘Henry, remember, that none of your
ancestors were cowards.’ I give the trait from recollection,
but have heard substantially the same account from other
sources. This is the secret of the perverse general admiration
of warriors, and heroes, and great generals. It is this
principle in its blindness, which finds a niche of favor in so
many hearts for duellists. In a word, intrepidity, deny it who
may, is the trait which finds more universal favor with human
nature in general than any other. Why? Because we
are weak and frail beings, exposed to innumerable pains
and dangers; and the quality we most frequently need, is
courage. Without it life is a living death, a long agony of
fear. With it, we die but once, enduring at the most but
a momentary pang, never anticipated, never embittering a
moment in advance with imaginary suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>We have no hesitation in affirming, that it would be no more
difficult to educate the coming generation of civilized people
to this spirit, than it is to impart it to the whole race of
males among the red men. However inferior we may count
these people, in comparison with ourselves in other respects,
they have at least one manifest advantage over us; they never
torment themselves, because they know they must die.</p>

<p>But we are told that the actual possession of this spirit would
produce such a recklessness of life, that the great ends of
Providence would be defeated; and people would expose
themselves to death with so little concern, that the race would
waste away and become extinct. We never need combat a
theory, an abstract opinion, when the case can be settled by a
fact. Is it so with the warriors of the red men? On the contrary,
can another people be found so wary, so adroit to evade,
or resist danger, so fertile in expedients to save life? The
coward of their number meets the death he would fly; and
the intrepid warrior puts forth all the resources of his instinctive
sagacity, all his keen and practised discernment,
to discover the best means of evasion. If he must
meet that death, which his skill cannot evade, nor his
powers resist, he instantly settles down upon the resource
of his invincible heroism of endurance.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the direct fruits of the intrepidity we would
wish to see universal, is, that it will give its possessor all possible
chances for preserving health and life. It saves him
from the influence of fear, a passion among the most debilitating,
and adverse to life, of any to which our nature is subject.
Braced by his courage, he passes untouched amidst a
contagious epidemic, to which the timid and apprehensive nature
falls a victim. In danger it gives him coolness and self-command,
to discover, and avail himself of all his chances of
wise resistance, or probable escape. In sickness, he has all
the aids to recover, which nature allows, in being delivered
from the most dangerous symptom in innumerable maladies,
the debilitating persuasion of the patient, that he shall not
rise from his sickness. In a word, the direct reverse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
charge is the fact. The wise and enlightened fearlessness,
which I consider it so important to acquire, is in every way as
much the preserver of life, as it is indispensable to happiness;
as cowardice proverbially runs in the face of the hideous monster
that it creates.</p>

<p>5. The fact, that an evil is felt to be alleviated, which is
shared in common with all around us, has been generally recognised,
though this perverted sympathy has been traced to
the basest selfishness, by a humiliating analysis of our nature,
which I have neither space nor inclination to develope. We
all know, that the same person, who is most beneficent, most
active in his benevolence, and large in his wishes to do good,
would shrink from a great calamity, which he saw himself destined
to encounter, for the first and the last among his whole race.
But inform him, that by an impartial award he shares it in common
with all his kind, and you reconcile him at once to his
lot. Whether the spirit of his resignation in this case be
pure, or polluted in its origin, it is not my present purpose to
inquire. It is sufficient to be assured, that there is such a
feeling deeply inherent in human nature. The suffering patient,
as he lays himself down to part from all friends, to be
severed from all ties, to see the green earth, the bright sun,
and the visible heavens no more, and to be conscious, that the
everlasting circle of ages will continue its revolutions without
ever bringing him back to the forsaken scene, cannot repine,
that he has been put upon this bitter trial alone. He must be
deeply conscious, view it in what aspect he may, that it presents
no new harshness nor horror to him. Of all the countless
millions, that have passed away, and been replaced by others,
like the vernal leaves, death has stood before every solitary
individual of the mighty mass, the same phantom king of terrors.
Each has contemplated the same inexorable, irreversible
award, been held in the same suspense of hopes, and fears,
and compelled to endure the same struggles. Looking upon
the immense mortal drama of ages, the actors seem slowly and
imperceptibly to enter, and depart from the scene. But in the
lapse of one short age, the hopes, fears, loves and hatreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
all the countless millions have vanished, to be replaced by
those of another generation. The heart swells at the recollection
how much each of these mortals must have endured,
in this stern and inevitable encounter, as measured by our own
suffering in the same case. It is only necessary for the patient
to extend his vision a few years in advance of his own
decease; and his friends, his children, his visitants, all that
surround him, will in their turn recline on the same bed.
Who cannot feel the palpable folly of repining at an evil
shared with all, that have been, are, or will be!</p>

<p>6. Philosophers and moralists will readily admit, that the
only easy and adequate remedy for the fear of death is the
hope of immortality. On the other hand, they, whose vocation
it is to question and decry the aids, which reason and
philosophy offer in the case, as sullen, cold, stoical, will not
deny, that ‘innumerable’ examples have been offered in
all countries, and in all time, of men, who, in virtue of no
higher discipline than that of reason and philosophy, have
met death with such unshrinking and invincible firmness, as
could hardly have been rendered more illustrious by any additional
motives. They have shown, beyond all question,
that nature has furnished us with a power of resistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
which, when rightly called forth, enables us to triumph
over fear and death. The pagans of ancient story, the unbelieving
of christian lands, the red men of our forests, offer
us demonstrations to any extent. I am aware, in what places
this simplest of all truths is weakly denied. Those, for
whom I write, are of the number who exact the truth; and I
have no fear to declare it; nor would I contend for a moment
with such as deny this fact.</p>

<p>But I am not the less sensible, that the triumph, in these
cases, is bitter and painful. It can only be obtained by a violence
done to instinctive nature, connected with innumerable
revulsions and horrors, and to all those ineffable clingings to
earth, and shrinkings from the first step into the unknown
land, that are partly the heritage of nature, and partly the result
of the concurrent influence of all our institutions. It is a violence
to all the passions, affections, hopes and fears fostered
by the earth. But the victory has been wrought, and can be
wrought, even though the bosom, in which it is wrought become
as of iron.</p>

<p>But the same triumph is won by the hope of immortality, by
a process, simple, easy, natural, in entire consonance with the
most tender affections and lively sympathies of flesh and
blood. We lie down in pain and agony, with a spirit of easy
endurance, if we have a confident persuasion that, during the
night, we shall have shaken off the cause of our sufferings,
and shall rise to renewed health and freshness in the morning.
Death can bring little terror to him, who believes that its
darkness will instantly be replaced by the light of another
scene: and that the separation from friends in the visible
land, is only rejoining the more numerous group, who have
already become citizens of the invisible country.</p>

<p>To what extent am I the subject of this hope myself; and
whence do I derive my belief? These are questions which
affection will ask; and the answers, if devoid of interest <em>now</em>,
will not be so when the <em>memory of things that were shall
come over the mind of the reader like a cloud</em>, and when read
as the thoughts of one, who, during his whole sojourn, felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and reflected intensely upon those subjects; and who will
then himself have passed away to the experience of all that
which is here matter of discussion. Those most dear to me
will know what relations I sustained to these subjects, during
the best part of my life; and will not be without solicitude
to know my final thoughts upon them; thoughts, purified at
least from all stain of party interest and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit du corps</i>, and
put forth in the simple consciousness of my own convictions,
however they may be powerless to produce belief in the mind
of any other. With the fierce war cry of sects in religion, in
their acrimonious and never ending contests about abstract
terms without a meaning, their combats about the vague and
technical phrases of formulas of faith, I have long since had
nothing to do. For many years they have rung on my ear
like the distant thunder of clouds that have passed by. To
the denunciations of those, who assume to hold all truth imprisoned
in their articles of confession, if I might hope the
distinction of receiving them, I am perfectly callous. Neither
would I desire to add another book to the millions of volumes
of polemic theology which already exist, and which
have as little bearing upon the knowledge, virtue and happiness
of the age, as the last year’s snow.</p>

<p>We are, after all, unconsciously influenced, and that in no
slight degree, by authority, however humble may be its
claims, as a test of truth. How did such a person believe
on such a point? Many a young aspirant suspends his opinion,
until he hears; and settles into fixed persuasion afterwards.
How many are there, in christian lands especially,
who have never had a wandering or unbelieving doubt of
the soul’s immortality float over their minds? How many,
who have had no terrene and gross ideas, influenced by
seeing the tenement of flesh, by which all that was called
the mind and the soul stood visible to the eye, and tangible
to the thought, yielded up to consumption and decay?
This is a question which no one can answer for another. For
myself, I believe unhesitatingly, and with no stain of doubt,
that I shall, in some way, exactly provided for by Him who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
made me, exist after death, as simply conscious, that I am the
same person, as I am now in the morning, that I slept at
night. Do I derive this conviction from books and reasonings?
I am by no means sure that I do; though the gospel assuredly
speaks directly to my heart. I do ready homage to the
talents and learning of Clarke, Locke, Paley, Channing and a
cloud of reasoning witnesses, of whom every Christian may
well be proud; and, most of all, to the profound and admirable
Butler.</p>

<p>I hear the author of our faith directly declaring a resurrection
and immortality. A single assertation from such a
source were enough. But I find him reasoning, and insisting
less upon the fact, than I should have expected, had he intended
to implant it in the mind, as it were a truth, chiefly to
be apprehended by the understanding. It seems to me that
he so discusses it, as one who was aware that it was already
inwoven in the sentiments and hearts of his hearers, vague,
dark, without moral consequence, it may be; but an existing
sentiment, taken for granted, upon which he might predicate
his doctrines, as upon a thousand other facts, which we
can clearly perceive, he considers already admitted by his
hearers.</p>

<p>Let a man walk in the fields on a June morning after night
showers. Let him seat himself for meditation on the hill-side,
under the grateful canopy of foliage. Let him ask himself to
embody his conceptions of the divinity, and to give form and
place to the Author of the glorious scene outstretched before
him. He may have just risen from reading the admirable demonstrations
of Clarke, and the astronomical sermons of Chalmers.
He may concentrate his conceptions by a fixedness
of study, that may amount to pain. He may bewilder
his faculties, in attempting to embody something, that his
thoughts and reasonings can grasp. I know not what the
powers of others can achieve in this case. But I know, by
painful experiment, what mine cannot. I ask my understanding
and reasoning powers about this glorious Being. They
inform me that it is a subject that comes not within their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
purview. They can follow the chain of reasoning, see that
every link is complete, and the demonstration irresistible.
But when they wish to avail themselves of their new truth,
they have no distinct idea either of premises or conclusion.
It has evaporated in the analysis.</p>

<p>I ask my heart, or the source of my moral sentiment, be
it what it may, the same question. The grateful verdure, the
matin freshness, the glad voices, the aroma of flowers, the
earth, the rolling clouds, the sun, all the lamps, that will burn
in the firmament by night, my own happy consciousness in
witnessing this impressive scene, cry out <em>a God</em>. To my
heart, it is the first, the simplest, most obvious thought, presenting
itself, it seems to me, as soon as the consciousness of
my own existence; certainly susceptible of as little doubt. I
have no need to define, analyze, embody. The moment I attempt
to do it, my thoughts are vague and unsettled. I yield
myself to the conviction. My heart swells with gratitude,
confidence, love. So good, so beneficent a Being can do
nothing but good, in this or any other world, to him who loves
and trusts him, and strives to obey his laws.</p>

<p>My most treasured hopes of immortality are from the same
source. Will this conscious being, capable of such remote
excursions into the two eternities between which its existence
is suspended, live beyond the present life? Not a particle
of matter, for ought that appears, can be annihilated.
Will the nobler thoughts, the warmer affections perish, as
though they had not been? We ask our senses, and they can
give us no hope. The body lives, and we speak of it as including
the conscious being. We see it die, pass under the
empire of corruption, molder, and incorporate with its kindred
elements. The sensible evidence, that the person exists, is
entirely destroyed. The most insatiate appetite of our natures,
however, craves continued existence, and ceases not to
seek for it. The inquirer after immortality cannot but be in
earnest in this pursuit. The arguments of the venerable sages
of old are spread before him. From the soul’s nature,
from the unity of consciousness, the incorruptibility of thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the everlasting progress, of which our faculties are capable,
the strong and unquenchable desire of posthumous fame, the
sacredness of earthly friendships, and similar arguments, they
strove to establish, on the basis of reasoning, the conviction
of immortality.</p>

<p>From these reasonings he repairs to the Scriptures. A
strange book, utterly unlike any writings that had appeared
before, declares that we shall exist forever. The religion
which has arisen from this book, in its whole structure and
dispensation, is predicated on the assumed fact, that we shall
exist forever in another life, happy or miserable, according to
our deeds on earth. Jesus, <em>the author and finisher of this faith</em>,
announces himself <em>the resurrection and the life</em>; with a voice
of power calls his dead friend from the tomb; declares, that
death has no power over himself; that, after suffering a violent
death, on the third day from that event, he shall arise from the
dead. He arises, according to his promise; and, in the midst
of his awe-struck friends he visibly ascends to his own celestial
sphere. Millions, as by one impulse, catch the spirit of
this wonderful book&mdash;love each other with anew and single-hearted
affection, as unlike the spirit of all former ties of
kindness and love, as the doctrines of this religion are different
from those of paganism. The new sect look with a careless
eye upon whatever is transitory; and will submit to privation,
derision and torture, of whatever form, rather than
waver, or equivocate, in declaring themselves subjects of this
hope of immortality. This Christian hope, in every period
from the time of its author, has made its way to the heart of
millions, who have laid themselves down on their last bed, and
felt the approach of their last sleep, expecting, as confidently
to open their eyes on an eternal morning, as the weary laborer,
at his evening rest, trusts that he shall see the brightness
of the morrow’s dawn.</p>

<p>I recur, with new and unsated satisfaction, to these arguments
for the soul’s immortality. I love to evoke the venerable
shades of Socrates and Plato and Cicero, and hear them,
each in his own way, persuade himself, that the thoughts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
affections, of which he was conscious, could only belong to an
immortal spirit. I listen to the eloquent and impressive
apostrophe of Tacitus, to the conscious spirit of him, whose
life he had so charmingly delineated, with feelings which I
cannot well describe.</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Si quis piorum manibus locus; si, ut sapientibus placet, non
cum corpore extinguontur magnæ animæ, placide quiescas;
nosque, domum tuam, ab infirmo desiderio, et muliebribus lamentis,
ad contemplationem virtutum tuarum voces, quas neque
lugeri, neque plangi fas est: admiratione te potius temporalibus
laudibus, et, si natura suppeditet, similitudine decoremus.’<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>I repair with new confidence and hope to the gospel, and
strive to imbibe the cheering conviction, as I hear Paul sublimely
declare, <em>that this corruptible shall put on incorruption,
and this mortal immortality, and that death shall be swallowed
up in victory</em>.</p>

<p>I have no disposition to deny that these arguments would be,
in themselves, insufficient to turn the balance against the evidence
of the senses, and produce the conviction of immortality
from the deductions of simple reason, if religion were an
impression to be raised and sustained by argument. But, if
we are religious, in some form, from our very constitution,
if immortality be felt as a sentiment, with more or less clearness
and force, I deem that these arguments have their appropriate
effect, in giving form and direction to this interior
sentiment; that believers have been such, because these
doctrines have found a concurrent sympathy in their spirit, a
suitableness to the wants of their heart, a development of the
germ of their hopes. It seems to me, that whoever has a
heart, cannot look upon the earth and the firmament, without
exclaiming ‘there is a God,’ nor within himself, without a
conviction, that his soul is immortal.</p>

<p>I see in the enthusiasm,&mdash;the embraces, cries, tears, swoonings
and the revolting extravagances of various sects under the
influence of high religious excitement, nothing more than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
morbid development of this latent religious sentiment. Instead
of being, as scoffers affirm, subjects of a mere factitious
intoxication, these people, who seem only to demand
wings, to soar aloft, are only manifesting the unregulated
action of nature working at the bottom of their hearts.</p>

<p>For myself I feel that I am immortal, and that those fellow
sojourners, to whom I have been attached by the affection of
long intimacy, and the reception of many and great kindnesses,
will exist with me hereafter. I pretend to conceive nothing,
I wish to inquire nothing, about the mode, the place and
circumstances. I should as soon think of disturbing myself,
by endeavoring to conceive the ideas that might be imparted
by a sixth sense. It is sufficient that my heart declares, that a
being who has seen this glorious world, cherished these warm
affections, entertained these illimitable aspirations, felt these
longings after immortality, indulged ‘<em>these thoughts, that wander
through eternity</em>,’ <em>cannot</em> have been doomed by Him, who
gave them, to have them quenched forever in annihilation.
Even an illusion so glorious would be worth purchasing at the
price of a world. I would affirm, even to repetition, that there is
given us that high and stern power, which implies a courage
superior to any conflict, and which gives the mind a complete
ascendency over any danger, pain or torture, which belongs
to life or death. But we would not be so extravagant, as for
a moment, to question that death, as the present generation
have been trained, and as we are accustomed, by all we see, and
hear to view it, is a formidable evil, fitly characterized by
its dread name, <em>the king of terrors</em>. Many a debilitating interior
misgiving will assail the stoutest mind, in certain moments,
in view of it. There are dark intervals by night, in
the midnight hours of pain, periods between the empire of
sleep and active reason, when the terrific and formless image
rushes in its terror and indefiniteness upon the mind. As age
steals upon us, and the vivid perceptions, and the bright dreams
of youth disappear, many a dark shadow will cloud the sunshine
of the soul. The conflict, in which all these terrors are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
overcome by unaided nature and reason is, as has been seen,
a cruel one. The tender sensibilities, the keen affections, the
dear and delusive hopes of our nature must all be crushed,
before we can be unmoved in the endurance of the pain and
torture that precede, and the death that follows.</p>

<p>It is only to a firm and unhesitating faith, that it becomes
as easy and natural to die, as to sleep. Glorious and blessed
hope, the hope of meeting our friends, in the eternal land
of those who truly and greatly live forever! There we shall
renew our youth, and <em>mount as on the wings of eagles</em>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p>That is an unworthy opponent, who assails what assumes
to be important truth, by no better argument than ridicule and
sarcasm. That is a despicable one, unworthy of exciting any
feelings but those of pity and contempt, who attempts to
bring to bear upon it the blind and fierce prejudices of the multitude.
This last is the prevalent mode of modern attack.
By those, who deem that wisdom will die with them, and that
they can learn nothing more, who dogmatize without examining,
and measure the views of others by their own preconceived
and settled opinions, all the foregoing doctrines, which
militate with the established prejudices and habits of the age,
will be denounced, I am aware, as heretical, imaginary, false.</p>

<p>‘He would teach people how to be happy,’ say they with a
sneer, ‘as though they were not compelled to pursue happiness
by a law of their natures.’ My business is not with such
opponents, and I should consider their opposition an honor
and a distinction.</p>

<p>The fact will remain true, be it welcomed, be it ridiculed,
as it may, that a few, in all time, have found the means of being
more comfortable and happy, than others in the same circumstances.
They had a method of their own in creating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
this difference. That method might be so indicated, as to be
reduced to general, and settled rules. This is the amount of
the foregoing doctrines. The object has been to discuss and
fix some of those rules. No moralist was ever so stupid, as
to expect, that the world would not pursue its headlong course,
inculcate what he might. Every one, who understands the
analogy of the present to the past, will expect that no form of
virtuous effort will be screened from question and ridicule; and
that no purity of purpose will conquer the blind and fierce
hate of the multitude.</p>

<p>But there will still be a few quiet, reflecting and philosophic
people. What is better, the number will be always increasing.
For such, are these my labors, and those, which I have
adopted from another, chiefly designed. Their suffrage is an
ample reward. Their plaudit is true fame. If they say, ‘we
and those about us may be better and happier; let us make
the effort to become so,’ my object is attained.</p>

<p>To encourage us to shake off the superincumbent load of
indifference, ridicule, and opposition, and to make efforts to
extend virtue and happiness, it is a sublime reflection, that a
thought may outlive an empire. Babylon and Thebes are, now,
nowhere to be found; but the moral lessons of the cotemporary
wise and good, despised and disregarded, perhaps, in their
day, have descended to us and are to be found everywhere.
As the seminal principles of plants, borne through the wide
spaces of the air by their downy wings, find at length a congenial
spot, in which to settle down, and vegetate, these seeds
of virtue and happiness, floating down the current of time, are
still arrested, from age to age, by some kindred mind, in which
they germinate, and produce their golden fruit. No intellect
can conjecture, in how many instances, and to what degree,
every fit moral precept may have come between the reason
and passions of some one, balancing between the course
of happiness and ruin, and may have inclined the scale in
his favor. The consciousness of even an effort to achieve one
such triumph is a sufficient satisfaction to a virtuous mind.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p class="customcover">The cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>The <a href="#ERRATA">ERRATA</a> (page vi) directs that the anchors for Notes [5] [29]
[32] and [51] be deleted, since actual Notes for these references
do not exist. However Note [51] does exist, it is Note [49] that
is missing. Therefore, anchors for [5] [29] [32] and [49] have
been deleted in this etext.  The ERRATA change for page 200,
(replace “Note 5, page 44.” with “Note 6, page 45.”) has also
been made.</p>

<p>In addition to these four missing references, several anchors
had the same number, but referenced two separate Notes. For clarity
the duplicate anchor number has been amended with an ‘a’ suffix.
The etext now has [15] and [15a]; [21] and [21a]; [24] and [24a];
[27] and [27a]; [28] and [28a]; and [39] and [39a].</p>

<p>There was a single anchor [53], but two separate Notes for this
one anchor. A second anchor [53a] has been added on page 152, and
the second Note heading “Note 53, page 150.” has been changed to
“Note 53a, page 152.”</p>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors have been corrected after careful
comparison with other occurrences within the text and consultation
of external sources.</p>

<p>  There are numerous typographical errors in the original text which
have been corrected in the etext. These are noted below.</p>

<p>Except for those specific changes also noted below, all misspellings
in the text, and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
